<b>Table Explanation:</b> <br />
Consider ChromSDE, the highest Resolution at which 3D structures could  be generated is 500kb. At this Resolution, Only Chromosome 10-23 could be generated within time and memory constraint.
<br />This also means that lower Hi-C data resoltion, i.e. 1MB, 2.5MB, will be available for this method
