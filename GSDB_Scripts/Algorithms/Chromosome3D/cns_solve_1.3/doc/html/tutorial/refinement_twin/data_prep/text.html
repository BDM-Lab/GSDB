<H2>Preparation of diffraction data</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>We will assume that the diffraction data has been converted to CNS
format using to_cns or CCP4. We will also assume that the twinning
operator and twinning fraction has already been identified (see
previous section). There will then be a reflection file containing the
observed structure factor amplitudes and estimated errors (sigma
values). Cross validation will be used to monitor the subsequent
refinement of the model and also to reduce bias in map
calculations. The cross validation information is added to the
reflection file using the CNS task file <TT>make_cv_twin.inp</TT>.</P>

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="make_cv_twin.inp">make_cv_twin.inp</A> &gt; make_cv_twin.out
</PRE>

<P>It is <I>essential</I> that this task file (and NOT the standard
make_cv.inp task file) is used to create the cross-validation set for
twinned data. The make_cv_twin.inp task file uses the twinning
operator to ensure that pairs of twin related reflections are in the
same set (either working or test).</P>

<P>A new reflection array is created, by default the name TEST is
used. The array contains integer numbers, by default 1 signifies that
the reflection will be used for cross-validation (i.e. excluded from
refinement). The output of the <TT>make_cv_twin.inp</TT> task file is
a CNS formatted reflection file. This will contain a header which
describes the data items in the file, followed by the data items
themselves. The file is plain ASCII and can be viewed with any text
viewer/editor.  Example header from a CNS reflection file with cross
validation information:</P>
