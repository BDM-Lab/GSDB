<H2>Checking the initial model</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>
   
<P>The structure used in this tutorial is that of a double mutant
(D97A,E99A) of the general diffusion porin from <I>Rhodopseudomonas
blastica</I> (B.Schmid, L.Maveyraud, M.Kromer, G.E.Schulz "Porin
mutants with new channel properties", Protein Science <B>7</B>,
1603-1611). The deposited refined model (7prn) and the structure
factors (r7prnsf) were obtained directly from the Protein Data
Bank. The twinning of the data had previously been identified
(T.O.Yeates, B.C.Fam "Protein crystals and their evil twins",
Structure <B>7</B>, 25-29). Comparison of the original model and that
after refinement with the twinning included shows negligible changes
in the protein structure.</P>

<P>Although the model has been previously refined against the data
(without twinning taken into account), and should therefore have
reasonable geometry, it is sensible to check the model prior to
starting refinement. In this example the CNS task file
<TT>model_stats_twin.inp</TT> is used to analyze the model geometry
and diffraction statistics. The results will indicate if the model has
poor geometry which can occur in the course of manual rebuilding or
also due to an error at the generate stage (see previous
section). Locating any possible problems prior to refinement will save
time later on.</P>

<P>The output listing file (<A
HREF="model_stats_twin.list">model_stats_twin.list</A>) contains a
variety of information which is self-explanatory. Important things to
note are:<P>

<P>Initial R-values:</P>

<pre>=================================== summary ==================================</pre>
<pre>resolution range: 500.0 - 2.25 A
   Twinned R-values:
   initial                                        r= 0.2773 free_r= 0.2328
   after B-factor and/or bulk solvent correction  r= 0.1962 free_r= 0.1945</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>

<P>Initial R-values that are very different from expected are usually
the result of a simple mistake such as incorrect space group, unit
cell dimensions, input diffraction data or input model.</P>

<P>This distribution of R-values is reasonable - there is no dramatic
increase in R-value (in particular free R-value) as resolution
increases. If there were resolution shells with R-values significantly
higher than the rest this might indicate possible problems with the
data processing (ice rings for example). However, the R-values
indicate the fit to the experimental data and should not be
manipulated by removing data - in particular by the use of sigma
cutoffs to exclude weak data.</P>

<P>The overall geometry:</P>

<PRE>
rmsd bonds= 0.020606 with 42 bond violations > 0.05
rmsd angles=  2.78530 with 14 angle violations >  8.0
rmsd dihedrals= 28.86228 with 2 angle violations >  60.0
rmsd improper=  2.32829 with 215 angle violations >  3.0
</PRE>

<P>If the model has been through extensive manual rebuilding the
initial geometry may have significant deviations from ideality. Any
major problem can be detected by the detailed geometry analysis
(below).</P>

<P>Specific problems with the model geometry can be identified
here. In particular the deviations for the bond lengths should be
checked. If there are very long bond lengths the model should be
checked. This can occur as a result of a mistake at the generate
stage, in particular forgetting to include a TER or BREAK card between
separate chains. If present, these unphysical bonds will cause serious
problems in refinement.</P>

<P>Non-trans peptide bonds:</P>

<PRE>
============================ non-trans peptides ==============================

there are no distorted or cis- peptide planes
</PRE>

<P>The presence of non-trans peptides, unless they are proline
residues, will cause problems in refinement. They can be identified,
and an appropriate parameter file created using the CNS task file
<TT>general/cis_peptide.inp</TT>. The parameter file generated is read
into subsequent refinement task files.</P>

<P>Statistics about detwinning of the data:</P>

<PRE>
================================ detwinning ==================================

data detwinned with: F_detwin   = (Fo^2 - alpha*[Fo^2 + Fo'^2])/(1 - 2*alpha)
                     Fo'[h,k,l] = Fo[h,-h-k,-l]
                     alpha      = 0.304

reflections rejected (I_detwin <= 0): 683
                         working set: 626
                            test set: 57

</PRE>

<P>The detwinning algorithm depends on whether the twinning is perfect
or partial. Some reflections are rejected during the detwinning
procedure because the resultant intensity is less than zero.</P>

<P>Detwinned R-values:</P>

<PRE>
============================ detwinned R-values ==============================

resolution range: 500.0 - 2.25 A
  R-values:
  after detwinning  r= 0.2637 free_r= 0.2764

</PRE>

<P>The R-values after detwinning are in greater in magnitude than the
twinned R-values.</P>
