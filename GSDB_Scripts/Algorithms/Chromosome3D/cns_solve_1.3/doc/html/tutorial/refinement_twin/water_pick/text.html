<H2>Automatically locating water molecules</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>A significant missing part of the model are ordered water molecules
(some can be clearly seen in the electron density maps). This is to be
expected at this resolution (2.25A).  We would proceed with much more
caution if the resolution of the data were significantly lower (2.5A
or worse). Water molecules are automatically picked using the CNS task
file <TT>water_pick_twin.inp</TT>:</P>

<P>The automated picking located several water molecules (or ions) at a
sigma level greater than 4 in a gradient map:</P>

<P>The B-factors and coordinates for the water molecules were refined
in the water picking script. In some cases it might be useful to
perform refinement of all B-factors and coordinates after the water
picking, especially if a large number of waters were found. We will
proceed to a final look at model statistics and maps (see next
section).</P>
