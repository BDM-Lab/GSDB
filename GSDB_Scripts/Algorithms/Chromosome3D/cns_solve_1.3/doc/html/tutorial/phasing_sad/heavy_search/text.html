<h2>Heavy-atom search</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

The heavy-atom search procedure of CNS can be applied
to various native and difference Patterson maps and their statistically
weighted averages.  Using the default parameters, a search for two
thirds of the number of expected sites is often successful. In the
example, 100 trials are carried out, searching for 6 of the expected 9
sites.

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="heavy_search.inp">heavy_search.inp</A> &gt; heavy_search.out
</PRE>

The beginning of the output file <tt>heavy_search.summary</tt> should be
looked at to check the input parameters. The 100
heavy-atom configurations found are stored in the files
<tt>heavy_search_*.sdb</tt>. A list of trial numbers and correlation
coefficients can be found in the file <tt>heavy_search.list</tt>.
Often it is useful to plot the list:

In many cases there are only a few outstanding correlation coefficients,
and the highest one normally corresponds to the correct heavy-atom
configuration. However, in the example the correct configuration was found
many times.
<p>
On Unix computers, the list file can easily be sorted.
<pre>
      sort -r heavy_search.list
</pre>
The beginning of the output shows that <tt>heavy_search_1.sdb</tt> is one of
the correct configurations.

       ...
</pre>

To aid the interpretation of the distribution of the
correlation coefficients, trials with a correlation coefficients
greater than 1.5 sigma of all trials are flagged with a plus sign.
<p>
The configuration corresponding to the top of the sorted list,
<tt>heavy_search_1.sdb</tt>, can be used in the
<tt>predict_patterson.inp</tt> task file for visual comparison of the
observed and calculated Patterson maps (see previous tutorial), and
as input for refinement of the heavy-atom parameters and computation of
experimental phases (see following tutorials).
