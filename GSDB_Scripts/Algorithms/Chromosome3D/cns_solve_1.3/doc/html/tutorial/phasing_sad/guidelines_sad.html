<h2>SAD phasing guidelines</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<h3>Preparation of diffraction data</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Use all data.</LI>
<LI>If possible, use the Wilson statistics to put the SAD data set on
an absolute scale. This is important because phase refinement sometimes
fails if the scale factor is very different from one. If Wilson
statistics cannot be used because the high resolution limit of the SAD
data is not at least 3 &Aring;, a high resolution native data set
should be used if available. Use the high resolution data set for the
determination of the absolute scale factor, and scale the SAD data
sets relative to this one.</LI>
</UL>

<h3>Validation of diffraction data</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Use <TT>analyse_anom_diff_*.distr</TT> to check the anomalous
signals by resolution shell and overall.</LI>
<LI>Visual inspection of the Harker sections of anomalous difference
Patterson maps is an alternative way to check anomalous signals. The
Harker sections should show a number of outstanding peaks (depending
on the number of anomalous scatterers).</LI>
</UL>

<h3>Heavy atom search</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Search for only &#126;2/3 of the total number of expected sites.</LI>
<LI>Resolution range: 15 &Aring; and 4 to 3 &Aring;.</LI>
<LI>Use heavy_search.list to identify heavy atom configurations with
outstanding correlation coefficients. Trials with a correlation
coefficients greater than 1.5 sigma of all trials are flagged with a
plus sign.</LI>
</UL>

<h3>Heavy atom model refinement and completion</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Use all data unless there are serious doubts about the quality of
the high resolution data.</LI>
<LI>Use SAD data set as &quot;Reference wavelength&quot;.</LI>
<LI>Approximate values for f' and f&quot; are usually sufficient.</LI>
<LI>Use the anomalous difference Fourier map in combination with the
(more powerful) gradient map to search for additional heavy atom
sites.</LI>
</UL>

<h3>Phase refinement, resolution of hand ambiguity, resolution of phase ambiguity</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Two heavy atom/phase refinements followed by density modification
are carried out in parallel, one for each hand of the heavy atom
configuration.</LI>
<LI>Density modification is used to resolve the phase ambiguity.</LI>
<LI>Visual inspection of the two density modified maps is used to
resolve the hand ambiguity. One map should show significantly better
solvent contrast and longer stretches of connected density.</LI>
<LI>The higher the solvent content the more powerful is the density
modification procedure.</LI>
<LI>If visual inspection of the maps does not give a clear indication,
review the <TT>sad_phase*.summary</TT> and
<TT>density_modify*.list</TT> files for the phasing and density
modification procedures, respectively. The phasing power in the low
resolution shells should be greater than about two. The higher the
better. The phasing power normally goes down in the high resolution
shells. It is often not a good sign if the phasing power is more or
less constant for all resolution shells, even if it is around two. For
SAD, the phasing figure of merit tends to be relatively low even for
good cases. A figure of merit of 0.3 in the low resolution shell could
be a good result. The density modification figure of merit should be
significantly different for the two hands of the heavy atom
configuration. The higher density modification figure of merit should
correspond to the correct map.</LI>
