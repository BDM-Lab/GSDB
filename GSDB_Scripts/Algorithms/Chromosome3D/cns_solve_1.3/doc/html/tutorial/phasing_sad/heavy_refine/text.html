<h2>Heavy-atom refinement/SAD phasing</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

The anomalous signal present in the diffraction data collected at an
absorption edge can be used to derive phases.  In order to do this the
crystal must contain sufficient anomalous scatterers.  Phasing using
the anomalous diffraction from a seleno-methionine labelled protein is
now common practice.

<p>

The heavy-atom sites are usually found using an automated method (see
previous tutorial). It is important to remember that there is a hand
ambiguity in the location of the sites. The search procedures are based
purely on amplitude information. However, a given heavy-atom
configuration and its inverse image give rise to identical diffraction
amplitudes. The hand ambiguity can be resolved by SAD phasing with
both choices, followed by inspection of the resulting electron density
maps. Only the correct hand will produce an interpretable map.

<p>

SAD phasing, like MAD phasing, is performed with the CNS task file
mad_phase.inp. Because in this case only one wavelength is used,
for clarity the file name is changed to <tt>sad_phase.inp</tt>.

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="sad_phase.inp">sad_phase.inp</A> &gt; sad_phase.out
</PRE>

The output files are:
<PRE>
        sad_phase.summary
        sad_phase.fp
        sad_phase.sdb
        sad_phase.hkl
        sad_phase_grad.hkl
</PRE>

The <tt>sad_phase.summary</tt> file contains information about the
progress of the SAD phasing procedure. The refined f' and f&quot can be
found in the <tt>sad_phase.fp</tt> file, and the refined heavy-atom
parameters are stored in the <tt>sad_phase.sdb</tt> site database file.
The refined phases are written to the <tt>sad_phase.hkl</tt> file as
Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients, and also as centroid phases and
corresponding figures of merit. The Fourier coefficients for the
gradient map are stored in the <tt>sad_phase_grad.hkl</tt> file.
The use of the <tt>hkl</tt> file for the detection of additional
heavy-atom sites is shown in the following tutorials.
