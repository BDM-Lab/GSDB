<H2>Distance geometry simulated annealing</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>
   
<P>Here a structure is calculated using experimentally measured
interproton distance estimates, hydrogen bonds and
coupling-constant-derived dihedral angle restraints. This protocol
uses ab simulated annealing starting from embedded substructures using
distance geometry calculations (based on the experimental data). The
structure calculation is performed with the CNS task file
<TT>dg_sa.inp</TT>.</P>

<P>In this protocol the extended coordinate template is used as a
starting point for generation of an embedded structure. This embedded
structure is generated using distance geometry calculations such that
the coordinates satisfy the known geometric and experimental distrance
restraints. The resulting coordinates need to be further regularized
with a simulated annealing protocol. In this case five trial
structures were generated. An alternative approach would have been to
only generated accepted structures, in which case the script would
have run until five accepted structures had been generated.</P>

<P>The embedded structures are written out first, prior to simulated
annealing refinement. Here the names are
trx_dg_sub_embed_[number].pdb. In this case, the backbone trace of the
coordinates shows the overall fold of the macromolecule:</P>

</TABLE>

<P>After generating the embedded structures, they are further refined
using simulated annealing. In this case the resulting structures have
a greater variation than those generated by ab initio simulated
annealing:</P>

<P>The information about violations can be used manually to select
acceptable structures. Instead the CNS task file <TT>accept.inp</TT>
can be used to identify acceptable structures and to calculate an
average conformation (see previous tutorial)</P>
