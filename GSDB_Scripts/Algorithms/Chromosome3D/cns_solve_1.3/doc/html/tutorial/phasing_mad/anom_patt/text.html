<h2>Anomalous difference Patterson map</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>The anomalous differences at the peak wavelength can be used to
make an anomalous difference Patterson map. This can be used to locate
the anomalous scatterers manually if there are only a few sites (1 or
2 should be possible). However, there are often more sites than this,
usually many more if seleno-methionine labelling has been used. The
large number of sites necessitates the use of automatic site location
methods. Whichever method is used, it is useful to calculate and check
the Patterson map first. The Patterson map is calculated with the CNS
task file <TT>patterson_map.inp.</TT></P>

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="patterson_map.inp">patterson_map.inp</A> &gt; patterson_map.out
</PRE>

<P>The output of the <TT>patterson_map.inp</TT> task file is a CNS
binary map for each of the Harker sections. These Harker sections will
be determined automatically by CNS, but are currently limited to those
sections which are parallel to unit cell axes (diagonal sections will
not be written). The Harker sections can be converted to a Postscript
image using the command <TT>plot_patterson</TT>. This takes
interactive input from the terminal:</P>

<PRE>
unix% plot_patterson
patterson map file -> patterson_map_z.map
patterson plane (x/y/z) -> z
postscript plot file [patterson.ps]-> patterson_map_z.ps
minimum contour level [2.0]->
contour increment [0.5]->
plot scale factor [0.06]->
plot title -> Experimental Patterson map Z-section
</PRE>

<P>It is important to note that the CNS Harker sections are written
out in binary format. Therefore, <TT>plot_patterson</TT> must be run
on the same type of machine as the <TT>patterson_map.inp</TT> task
file was also run.</P>

<P>In the example used here the space group is P6 so there is only one
Harker section (at Z=0). This is calculated at the peak anomalous
wavelength for selenium, and shows peaks due to the 8 ordered
seleno-methionine sites which are present in the crystal. Below are
the Patterson maps calculated from the experimental data (top), and
from the known locations of the selenium sites (bottom). These sites
were located using automatic methods (see the other tutorials for
details). The command to calculate the Patterson map from the known
locations of the selenium sites is:
<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="predict_patterson.inp">predict_patterson.inp</A> &gt; predict_patterson.out
</PRE>

<P>Again, the <TT>plot_patterson</TT> command is used to convert the
Harker sections to a Postscript image:

<PRE>
unix% plot_patterson
patterson map file -> predict_patterson_z.map
patterson plane (x/y/z) -> z
postscript plot file [patterson.ps]-> predict_patterson_z.ps
minimum contour level [2.0]->
contour increment [0.5]->
plot scale factor [0.06]->
plot title -> Predicted Patterson map Z-section
</PRE>
