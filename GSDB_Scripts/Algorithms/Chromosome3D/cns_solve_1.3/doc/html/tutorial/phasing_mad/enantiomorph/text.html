<h2>Resolution of the enantiomorph ambiguity</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

This tutorial shows how to compute electron density maps based on the
results of MAD phasing runs, and how to use them to resolve the
<a href="../../other/ambiguities_in_phasing.html#enantiomorph"
>enantiomorph ambiguity</a>.

<p>

The enantiomorph ambiguity can be resolved by MAD phasing with the
original heavy atom configuration and its inverse image, followed by
inspection of the resulting electron density maps.  Only the correct
enantiomorph will produce an interpretable map.

<p>

The electron density maps are computed with the observed structure
factors measured at a remote wavelength, and MAD phases.  The input
files are derived from the <tt>fourier_map.inp</tt> task file in the
<tt>inputs</tt> directory.

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="fourier_map_elec.inp">fourier_map_elec.inp</A> &gt; fourier_map_elec.out
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="fourier_map_elec_flip.inp">fourier_map_elec_flip.inp</A> &gt; fourier_map_elec_flip.out
</PRE>

The two resulting map files are:
<PRE>
      fourier_map_elec.map       fourier_map_elec_flip.map
</PRE>
<p>They can be visiualized with Coot or PyMol. For PyMol, you should rename the .map extension to .xplor so PyMol properly recognizes the CNS map format.</p>

</TABLE>

The electron density map based on the inverted sites
(<tt>fourier_map_elec_flip.map</tt>) clearly shows a contrast between
protein regions and solvent regions. The electron density in the
map based on the original sites is much more evenly distributed
in the asymmetric unit of the unit cell. This means, we have
established that the inverted heavy atom configuration is
the correct choice.

<p>

Sometimes, for example if there are problems with the quality of the
data or only a small subset of the heavy atom sites is known, neither
of the two electron density maps shows a clear contrast between protein
regions and solvent regions. In such a case, density modification should
be performed and the new electron density maps inspected.
