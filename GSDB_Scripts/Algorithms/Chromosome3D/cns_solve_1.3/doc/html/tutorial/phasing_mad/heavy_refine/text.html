<h2>Heavy-atom refinement/MAD phasing</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

The information present in the anomalous diffraction at several
different wavelengths can be used to derive phases. In order to do this
the crystal must contain sufficient anomalous scatterers, and data must
be collected at the appropriate wavelengths. Phasing using the
anomalous diffraction from a seleno-methionine labelled protein is now
common practice.

<p>

The heavy-atom sites are usually found using an automated method (see
previous tutorial). It is important to remember that there is an <a
href="../../other/ambiguities_in_phasing.html#enantiomorph" >enantiomorph
ambiguity</a> in the location of the sites. The search procedures are
based purely on amplitude information. However, a given heavy-atom
configuration and its inverse image give rise to identical diffraction
amplitudes. The enantiomorph ambiguity can be resolved by MAD phasing
with both choices, followed by inspection of the resulting electron
density maps. Only the correct hand will produce an interpretable map.

<p>

For the two independent MAD phasing jobs, two site database files
are needed, one with the original heavy atom configuration and another
with its inverse image. The file with the inverse image is generated
with the <tt>flip_sites.inp</tt> task file.

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="flip_sites.inp">flip_sites.inp</A> &gt; flip_sites.out
</PRE>

The task files for the two independent MAD phasing jobs are identical
except for the definitions of the file names for the heavy atom sites
and the output file names.

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="mad_phase.inp">mad_phase.inp</A> &gt; mad_phase.out
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="mad_phase_flip.inp">mad_phase_flip.inp</A> &gt; mad_phase_flip.out
</PRE>

There are two sets of output files, one for each input file:
<PRE>
        mad_phase.summary       mad_phase_flip.summary
        mad_phase.fp            mad_phase_flip.fp
        mad_phase.sdb           mad_phase_flip.sdb
        mad_phase.hkl           mad_phase_flip.hkl
        mad_phase_grad.hkl      mad_phase_flip_grad.hkl
</PRE>

The <tt>*.summary</tt> files contain information about the progress of
the MAD phasing procedure. The refined f' and f&quot can be found in
the <tt>*.fp</tt> files, and the refined heavy-atom parameters are
stored in the <tt>*.sdb</tt> site database files. The refined phases
are written to the <tt>*.hkl</tt> files as Hendrickson-Lattman
coefficients, and also as centroid phases and corresponding figures of
merit. The Fourier coefficients for the gradient maps are stored in the
<tt>*_flip_grad.hkl</tt> files. The use of the <tt>hkl</tt> files for
the determination of the correct hand and the detection of additional
heavy-atom sites is shown in the following tutorials.
