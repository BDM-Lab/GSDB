<a name="indexing"><h3>Indexing ambiguities</h3></a>

<h4>Indexing ambiguity type 1</h4>

In space groups where the symmetry of the Bravais lattice is higher
than the point group symmetry, there are several choices of indexing a
diffraction pattern. When confronted with several indexing
possibilities, autoindexing programs like <em>Denzo</em>,
<em>MOSFLM</em> and <em>d*trek</em> can only make a random choice.
However, if data from two or more crystals are to be merged or combined
in some other way (for example to compute isomorphous differences), it
is important that the indexing choices are compatible.

<p>

The <em>CCP4</em> documentation
(<a href="http://www.dl.ac.uk/CCP/CCP4/dist/html/reindexing.html"
 ><tt>reindexing.doc</tt></a>)
and the
<a href="http://www.hkl-xray.com/manual_j.pdf"><em>Scalepack</em></a>
manual (Scenario&nbsp;5: Reindexing) give practical advise for
resolving the indexing ambiguity. The general idea is that the indexing
choice of some reference data set is kept fixed, and all possible
indexing choices are tested for the other data sets. For each indexing
choice, a data set is reindexed, scaled and merged with the reference
data set.  The correct indexing choice is characterized by the lowest
R<sub>merge</sub> or Chi<sup>2</sup>.

<h4>Indexing ambiguity type 2</h4>

Another problem arises if anomalous scattering leads to the breakdown
of Friedel's law. If the data are correctly indexed on a right handed
basis system, the assignment of &quot;F+&quot; and &quot;F-&quot; is
such that the experimental electron density map will show amino acids
and helices with the correct hand. However, if by accident a left
handed system was chosen (for example if the sign of <tt>Y SCALE</tt>
in <em>Denzo</em> was chosen incorrectly), the experimental electron
density map will have the wrong hand.

<p>

If anomalous data are used and the experimental MAD or SAD map shows
amino acids and helices with the wrong hand, the Friedel mates have to
be flipped in order to arrive at a right handed indexing basis. This
means, &quot;F+&quot; becomes &quot;F-&quot; and vice versa. At
the same time, the hand of the heavy atom configuration has to be
changed (see below).
<p>
Use the <tt>flip_friedels.inp</tt> task file to flip the Friedel
mates.

Use the <tt>flip_sites.inp</tt> task file to flip the heavy atom
configuration.

<a name="enantiomorph"><h3>Enantiomorph ambiguity</h3></a>

A given 3-dimensionally periodic configuration of atoms and its inverse
image give rise to identical diffraction patterns. For crystals with a
centrosymmetric space group this is trivially true. For
non-centrosymmetric space groups this gives rise to a hand ambiguity or
<em>enantiomorph ambiguity</em> (<em>Protein Crystallography</em>,
Blundell &amp; Johnson, 1976, page 374).

<p>

For non-centrosymmetric space groups, there always exists a centre of
inversion which maps the given atom configuration onto its inverse
image. For most non-centrosymmetric space groups, this centre of
inversion is at the origin of the coordinate system (i.e. at 0,0,0)
and the inverse image is obtained simply by flipping the signs of the
atomic coordinates. However, there can be two kinds of difficulties:

<ol>
<li><strong>The centre of inversion is not at the origin of the
            coordinate system.</strong>
    <br>
    This is the case for space groups Fdd2, I4<sub>1</sub>,
    I4<sub>1</sub>22, I4<sub>1</sub>md, I4<sub>1</sub>cd, I-42d, and
    F4<sub>1</sub>32.
    <br>
    In these space groups, the inverse image is obtained by a
    combination of flipping the signs of the coordinates and a
    translation (International Tables for Crystallography, Volume A,
    1983, Table 15.3.2, column 6).

    <p>

    <li><strong>The centre of inversion changes the space group.</strong>
    <br>
    This is the case for the 22 <em>enantiomorphic</em> space groups.
    <br>
    The 22 enantiomorphic space groups can be grouped into 11 pairs:
    <p>
    <TABLE BORDER="1">
      <tr>
      <td>P4<sub>1</sub>
      <td>P4<sub>1</sub>22
      <td>P4<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2
      <td>P3<sub>1</sub>
      <td>P3<sub>1</sub>12
      <td>P3<sub>1</sub>21
      <td>P6<sub>1</sub>
      <td>P6<sub>2</sub>
      <td>P6<sub>1</sub>22
      <td>P6<sub>2</sub>22
      <td>P4<sub>1</sub>32
      <tr>
      <td>P4<sub>3</sub>
      <td>P4<sub>3</sub>22
      <td>P4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2
      <td>P3<sub>2</sub>
      <td>P3<sub>2</sub>12
      <td>P3<sub>2</sub>21
      <td>P6<sub>3</sub>
      <td>P6<sub>4</sub>
      <td>P6<sub>3</sub>22
      <td>P6<sub>4</sub>22
      <td>P4<sub>3</sub>32
    </table>
    <p>
    The atomic coordinates of the inverse image are obtained by
    flipping the signs of the original coordinates. If the space group
    of the original atom configuration is listed in the top row of the
    table, the space group of the inverse image is given in the same
    column in the bottom row, and vice versa.
</ol>

The <tt>flip_sites.inp</tt> task file can be used to flip an atom
configuration. The two kinds of difficulties outlined above are
correctly taken care of.

<p>

In isomorphous replacement (SIR/MIR) experiments, the enantiomorph
ambiguity can be resolved by inspection of the experimental electron
density map.  If the amino acids and helices have the wrong hand, the
heavy atom configuration has to be flipped.

<p>

In anomalous diffraction (SAD/MAD) experiments, the enantiomorph
ambiguity can be resolved by SAD/MAD phasing with both choices,
followed by inspection of the resulting electron density maps. Only
the correct enantiomorph will produce an interpretable map.

<p>

For a clarification of the terms <em>enantiomorph</em> and
<em>enantiomorphic space group</em> refer to the International Tables
for Crystallography, Volume A, 1983, section 10.5,
<em>Enantiomorphism</em>, <em>enantiomerism</em>, <em>chirality</em>,
<em>dissymmetry</em>.

<a name="phase"><h3>Phase ambiguity</h3></a>

In Single Isomorphous Replacement (SIR) or Single Anomalous Diffraction
(SAD) experiments, the resulting phase probability distributions are
bimodal, i.e. there are two maxima in the probablity distribution for
each reflection. This is explained in detail in many textbooks, for
example <em>Protein Crystallography</em>, Blundell &amp; Johnson, 1976,
or <em>Principles of Protein X-ray Crystallography</em>, Drenth, 1994.

<p>

In many cases, density modification can be used to resolve the phase
ambiguity. In <em>CNS</em>, use the task file
<tt>density_modify.inp</tt>.
