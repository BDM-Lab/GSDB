<P>In accordance with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, the entry for
atoms is defined as follows:</P>

            ^ additional character for some atom names (mostly h's)

<P>CNS will also interpret BREAK, TER, and END cards.  It will ignore all other cards.</P>
<P>Notes:</P>
<ul>
  <li>The atom serial number is encoded upon output with WRITE COORdinates as hybrid-36 character string if the number exceeds 99999. However, it is ignored upon reading PDB files. </li>
  <li>The resid can be encoded within the 4-character limit as a hybrid-36 character string if it exceeds 9999 and is less than 2436112.  Please note that CNS treats the resid in most places as 4-character string, including PDB I/O, selections by RESId, and most print statements. For selection by numerical residue range (e.g., (resid 1:40)) a hybrid-36 string will be decoded into an integer in order to enable numerical comparisons. Strings that cannot be decoded into an integer are treated as zero.</li>
  <li>Hybrid-36 is base-36 (upper-case and then lower-case) plus an offset to align with plain integer numbers. For more information see <a href="http://cci.lbl.gov/hybrid_36/">http://cci.lbl.gov/hybrid_36/</a>. </li>
