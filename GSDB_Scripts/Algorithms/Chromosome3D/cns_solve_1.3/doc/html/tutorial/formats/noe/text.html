<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>NOE distance restraints are specified with the following
syntax:</P>

<PRE>
ASSIgn atom-selection atom-selection real real real 
</PRE>

<P>The atom selections define the atoms (or groups of atoms) between
which the distance restraint will be applied. The following real
numbers determine the parameters of the distance restraint: d (the
distance), and dminus, and dplus (the extents either side of this
distance) respectively.</P>

<P><U>Example:</U></P>

<PRE>
assign (resid 112 and name n)  (resid 74 and name o)  2.8 0.4 0.9
assign (resid 112 and name hn) (resid 74 and name o)  1.8 0.4 0.9
assign (resid 74 and name n)   (resid 112 and name o) 2.8 0.4 0.9
assign (resid 74 and name hn)  (resid 112 and name o) 1.8 0.4 0.9
</PRE>

<P>In CNS, the setup of pseudoatoms is accomplished by the ASSIgn
statement, with multiple protons in either atom selection. For the
restraining functions, CNS computes either an R-6 averaged distance
between the involved protons or the distance between the geometric
centers of the two specified atom selections. For distance geometry,
CNS automatically applies a pseudoatom correction to the specified
distance ranges.  Pseudoatoms (multiple atom selections) should be
used primarily for unresolved NOE cross peaks, like those of methyl
groups, prochiral centers, and aromatic rings. In the case of
stereospecific assignments, the distances should be exact.</P>

<P><U>Example:</U></P>

<PRE>
assign (resid 4 and name HG#) (resid 4 and name HE2#) 4.0 2.2 1.0
assign (resid 4 and name HG#) (resid 4 and name HE2#) 3.0 1.2 1.0
assign (resid 4 and name HA ) (resid 4 and name HE2#) 4.0 2.2 1.0 
</PRE>

<P>The NOE distance restraints are read into CNS by the NOE
statement:</P>

<PRE>
NOE
  class noe
  nrestraints=500
  assign (resid 4 and name HG#) (resid 4 and name HE2#) 4.0 2.2 1.0
END
</PRE>

<P>In the distributed task files for NMR structure calculation the
user only needs to provide a file with the ASSIGN statements. For
example the NOE distance restraints used in the tutorial <A
HREF=../../data/trx/trx_noe_all.tbl>trx_noe_all.tbl</A>. Hydrogen bond
distance restraints have the same format.</P>
