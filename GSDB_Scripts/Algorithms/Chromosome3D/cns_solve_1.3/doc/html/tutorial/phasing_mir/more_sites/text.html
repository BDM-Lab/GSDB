<h2>Completion of the heavy-atom model</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

The MIR phases can be used in combination with the isomorphous
amplitude differences to compute an isomorphous difference
Fourier map.  This map is useful in the search for additional
heavy-atoms sites. However, a more powerful method for the location of
missing sites is the computation of a double-difference or
log-likelihood gradient map. To this end, the structure factors in
<tt>mir_phase_2deriv_grad.hkl</tt> can be used.

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="fourier_phga.inp">fourier_phga.inp</A> &gt; fourier_phga.out
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="gradient_phga.inp">gradient_phga.inp</A> &gt; gradient_phga.out</PRE>
Each job produces three output files.
<PRE>
      fourier_phga.map             gradient_phga.map
      fourier_phga_negative.peaks  gradient_phga_negative.peaks
      fourier_phga_positive.peaks  gradient_phga_positive.peaks
</PRE>

The 30 highest positive and negative peaks in both maps are
written in PDB format to the <tt>*.peaks</tt> files.
<p>
Here are the maps:

Additional heavy-atom sites are usually characterized by peaks in both
the isomorphous difference and the gradient map. In the image above,
the two highest peaks in the gradient map are at locations with high
densities in the isomorphous difference map. Inspection of
<tt>gradient_phga_positive.peaks</tt> reveals that these are
significantly greater than the other peaks:</P>

<PRE>
ATOM      1 PEAK PEAK    1      25.916  22.511  26.861  1.00 13.45      PEAK
ATOM      2 PEAK PEAK    2      14.713   9.913  39.363  1.00 10.43      PEAK
ATOM      3 PEAK PEAK    3      -7.468   9.754  25.417  1.00  7.80      PEAK
ATOM      4 PEAK PEAK    4      11.119   4.834  44.493  1.00  7.55      PEAK
</PRE>

These 2 top peaks are therefore added to the heavy atom model for the
mercury derivative. With isomorphous replacement using heavy atoms we
cannot be sure how many sites we will obtain. In particular, heavy
atoms may bind weakly resulting in poorly occupied sites. It is
difficult to decide at which point to ignore further peaks in the
gradient and isomorphous difference maps. Fortunately, weak sites will
contribute little to the phasing, and will refine to a low
occupancy. Sites which are incorrectly assigned will usually refine to
occupancies close to zero. Inspection of the negative peaks in the
gradient map may also help indicate sites which are incorrectly
placed.
<p>

<p>
The 2 top peaks from the gradient map must be added to the exisiting
mercury sites. The CNS task file <tt>sdb_manipulate.inp</tt> is used
to add two more entries to the <tt>phga_sites.sdb</tt> site database
file:</P>

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="sdb_manipulate.inp">sdb_manipulate.inp</A> &gt; sdb_manipulate.out</PRE>

The name of the expanded file is <tt>phga_five_sites.sdb</tt>.  Use
<tt>cns_edit</tt> and copy-and-paste the coordinates from
<code>gradient_phga_positive.peaks</code>:

<PRE>
      cns_edit phga_five_sites.sdb
</PRE>

<P>We will assume that the same methods are used to locate further
sites in the other derivative datasets. When all heavy atom models are
updated then a final round of MIR phasing can be performed. In this
example the CNS task file <TT>mir_phase_final.inp</TT> is used:</P>

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="mir_phase_final.inp">mir_phase_final.inp</A> &gt; mir_phase_final.out</PRE>

The new MIR phases can then be used to compute an electron density
map, or as starting phases for density modification (see next
tutorial).
