<h2>Isomorphous difference Patterson map</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>The isomorphous differences between the native and a derivative
dataset can be used to make an isomorphous difference Patterson
map. This can be used to locate the heavy atoms manually if there are
only a few sites (1 or 2 should be possible). Sometimes, there are
more sites than this. A large number of sites necessitates the use of
automatic site location methods. Whichever method is used, it is
useful to calculate and check the Patterson map first. The Patterson
map is calculated with the CNS task file
<TT>patterson_map.inp.</TT></P>

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="patterson_map.inp">patterson_map.inp</A> &gt; patterson_map.out
</PRE>

<P>The output of the <TT>patterson_map.inp</TT> task file is a CNS
binary map for each of the Harker sections. These Harker sections will
be determined automatically by CNS, but are currently limited to those
sections which are parallel to unit cell axes (diagonal sections will
not be written). The Harker sections can be converted to a Postscript
image using the command <TT>plot_patterson</TT>. This takes
interactive input from the terminal:</P>

<PRE>
unix% plot_patterson
patterson map file -> patterson_map_y.map
patterson plane (x/y/z) -> y
postscript plot file [patterson.ps]-> patterson_map_y.ps
minimum contour level [2.0]->
contour increment [0.5]->
plot scale factor [0.06]->
plot title -> Experimental Patterson map Y-section
</PRE>

<P>It is important to note that the CNS Harker sections are written
out in binary format. Therefore, <TT>plot_patterson</TT> must be run
on the same type of machine as the <TT>patterson_map.inp</TT> task
file was also run.</P>

<P>In the example used here the space group is C2 so there is only one
Harker section (at Y=0). This is calculated using the native
amplitudes and a uranyl derivative. The Harker section shows peaks due
to the heavy atoms which are present in the derivatized crystal. Below
are the Patterson maps calculated from the experimental data (top),
and from the known locations of 3 heavy atom sites (bottom). These
sites were located using automatic methods (see the other tutorials
for details). The command to calculate the Patterson map from the
known locations of the sites is:
<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="predict_patterson.inp">predict_patterson.inp</A> &gt; predict_patterson.out
</PRE>

<P>Again, the <TT>plot_patterson</TT> command is used to convert the
Harker sections to a Postscript image:

<PRE>
unix% plot_patterson
patterson map file -> predict_patterson_y.map
patterson plane (x/y/z) -> y
postscript plot file [patterson.ps]-> predict_patterson_y.ps
minimum contour level [2.0]->
contour increment [0.5]->
plot scale factor [0.06]->
plot title -> Predicted Patterson map Y-section
</PRE>
