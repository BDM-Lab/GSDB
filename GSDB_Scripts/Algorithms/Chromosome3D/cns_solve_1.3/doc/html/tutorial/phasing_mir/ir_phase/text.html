<h2>Heavy-atom refinement/SIR phasing</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

The information present in the isomorphous diffraction differences
between a native and different derivative datasets can be used to
derive phases. In order to do this there must be a sufficient number
of heavy atom sites in the derivative. A common reason for the failure
of isomorphous replacement is a large degree of non-isomorphism
between native and derivative. This may be apparent from large unit
cell changes (more than 1%) or isomorphous differences which are too
large (more than 25%). In general there is often some non-isomorphism,
which is usually more significant at higher resolution, this will
limit the effective resolution of the phasing.
<p>

The heavy-atom sites are usually found using an automated method (see
previous tutorial). It is important to remember that there is a hand
ambiguity in the location of the sites. The search procedures are
based purely on amplitude information. However, a given heavy-atom
configuration and its inverse image give rise to identical diffraction
amplitudes. The hand ambiguity cannot be resolved unless anomalous
diffraction information is available. In general therefore the hand
ambiguity can only be resolved by visual analysis of the resulting
electron density map. The handedness of secondary structure elements
such as alpha-helices or the chirality of amino acids (given
sufficient resolution of the data) will indicate if the heavy atom
sites need to be inverted.

<p>

In this example SIR phasing is performed with the CNS task file
ir_phase_kuof.inp. We will perform SIR phasing using the native
amplitudes and a uranyl derivative dataset. Three heavy atom sites
have already been located using automated methods (see previous
tutorial).

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="ir_phase_kuof.inp">ir_phase_kuof.inp</A> &gt; ir_phase_kuof.out
</PRE>

There are several output files:
<PRE>
        ir_phase_kuof.summary 
        ir_phase_kuof.sdb     
        ir_phase_kuof.hkl     
        ir_phase_grad_kuof.hkl
</PRE>

The <tt>*.summary</tt> file contains information about the progress of
the SIR phasing procedure. The refined heavy-atom parameters are
stored in the <tt>*.sdb</tt> site database file. The refined phases
are written to the <tt>*.hkl</tt> files as Hendrickson-Lattman
coefficients, and also as centroid phases and corresponding figures of
merit. The Fourier coefficients for the gradient maps are stored in
the <tt>*_grad.hkl</tt> file. The use of the <tt>hkl</tt> file for
the detection of additional heavy-atom sites is shown in the following
tutorials.
