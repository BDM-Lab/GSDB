<h2>Location of heavy atoms for other derivatives</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

The SIR phases calculated from the uranyl derivative can be used in
combination with the isomorphous amplitude differences from a mercury
derivative to calculate a Fourier map (we will call this a
cross-phased map). Assuming that the SIR phases are reasonable, this
map will show the location of the mercury heavy atom sites. To
calculate the cross-phased Fourier map the CNS script
<TT>cross_phase_phga.inp</TT> is used.

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="cross_phase_phga.inp">cross_phase_phga.inp</A> &gt; cross_phase_phga.out
</PRE>
Three output files are produced.
<PRE>
      cross_phase_phga.map           
      cross_phase_phga_negative.peaks
      cross_phase_phga_positive.peaks
</PRE>

The 30 highest positive and negative peaks are written in PDB format
to the <tt>*.peaks</tt> files. 
<p>
Here is the map; also displayed are the positions of the peaks (by reading the cross_phase_phga_positive.peaks as a PDB file into Coot, PyMol, or O).<HR WIDTH="67%">

<TD ALIGN=CENTER>Cross-phased map (contoured at 7.5 sigma) showing the location of
mercury heavy atom sites.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<HR WIDTH="67%">

<p>
There are 3 clear peaks in the map above 7.5 sigma. These are taken as
the initial sites for the mercury derivative. This is carried out by
copying the cross_phase_phga_positive.peaks file to phga.pdb. This
file is then edited manually to leave only the top 3 peaks and the END
record:

<PRE>
ATOM      1 PEAK PEAK    1      14.542   9.673  43.436  1.00 23.85      PEAK
ATOM      2 PEAK PEAK    2      -6.783   2.796  36.629  1.00 12.52      PEAK
ATOM      3 PEAK PEAK    3      11.681  20.605   9.361  1.00 11.39      PEAK
END
</PRE>

<p>
This PDB format file is then converted to the CNS site-database format
using the CNS task file <TT>pdb_to_sdb.inp</TT>:
</p>

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="pdb_to_sdb.inp">pdb_to_sdb.inp</A> &gt; pdb_to_sdb.out</PRE>

<p>Now that we have located heavy atom sites for a uranyl and mercury
derivative MIR phasing can be carried out. In this example the CNS
task file <TT>mir_phase_2deriv.inp</TT> is used:</P>

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="mir_phase_2deriv.inp">mir_phase_2deriv.inp</A> &gt; mir_phase_2deriv.inp</PRE>

The new MIR phases can then be used to compute other cross-phased
Fourier maps to locate sites for other derivatives, complete the heavy
atom model for the current derivatives (see next tutorial), or as
starting phases for density modification (see later tutorial).
