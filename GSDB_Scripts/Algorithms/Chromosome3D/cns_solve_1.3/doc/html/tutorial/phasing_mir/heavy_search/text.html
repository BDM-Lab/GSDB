<h2>Heavy-atom search</h2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

The heavy-atom search procedure of CNS can be applied to various
native and difference Patterson maps and their statistically weighted
averages.  Using the default parameters, a search for two thirds of
the number of expected sites is often successful. In the example, 100
trials are carried out, searching for 3 sites.

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="heavy_search.inp">heavy_search.inp</A> &gt; heavy_search.out
</PRE>

The beginning of the output file <tt>heavy_search.summary</tt> should
be looked at to check the input parameters. The 100 heavy-atom
configurations found are stored in the files
<tt>heavy_search_*.sdb</tt>. A list of trial numbers and correlation
coefficients can be found in the file <tt>heavy_search.list</tt>.
Often it is useful to plot the list:

</center>
<P>In many cases there are only a few outstanding correlation
coefficients, and the highest one normally corresponds to the correct
heavy-atom configuration. In this example the highest correlation
coefficient is seen for the first 3 trials.</P>
<p>
On Unix computers, the list file can easily be sorted.
<pre>
      sort +1n -r heavy_search.list
</pre>
The beginning of the output shows that <tt>heavy_search_1.sdb</tt> is one of
the correct configurations.
<pre>
       +1 0.5589
       +2 0.5589
       +3 0.5589
       51 0.4353
        8 0.4353
       68 0.4352
       47 0.4230
       16 0.4130
       ...
</pre>

To aid the interpretation of the distribution of the
correlation coefficients, trials with a correlation coefficients
greater than 1.5 sigma of all trials are flagged with a plus sign.
<p>
The best configuration corresponding, <tt>heavy_search.sdb</tt>, can
be used in the <tt>predict_patterson.inp</tt> task file for visual
comparison of the observed and calculated Patterson maps (see previous
tutorial), and in the <tt>ir_phase.inp</tt> task file for refinement
of the heavy-atom parameters and computation of experimental phases
(see following tutorials).
