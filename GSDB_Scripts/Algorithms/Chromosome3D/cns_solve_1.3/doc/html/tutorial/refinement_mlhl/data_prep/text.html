<H2>Preparation of diffraction data</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>In this section we discuss refinement in the presence of phase information. When phase information is available (especially experimental phase information) it can be beneficial to use this information during refinement and map calculations. The only differences to the refinement examples discussed in sections <a href="../refinement_high_resolution/data_prep/text.html">Structure refinement at high to medium resolution</a> and <a href="../refinement_low_resolution/refinement/text.html">Structure refinement at low resolution</a> are the choice of the refinement target (<tt>mlhl</tt> instead of <tt>mlf</tt>) and the map type (<tt>combined</tt> instead of <tt>sigmaa</tt>). The following example illustrates the use of experimental phase information. </P>
<P>We will assume that the diffraction data has been converted to CNS
  format using to_cns or CCP4. There will then be a reflection file
  containing the observed structure factor amplitudes and estimated
  errors (sigma values). Cross validation will be used to monitor the
  subsequent refinement of the model and also to reduce bias in map
  calculations. The cross validation information is added to the
  reflection file using the CNS task file <TT>make_cv.inp</TT>.</P>

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="make_cv.inp">make_cv.inp</A> &gt; make_cv.out</PRE>

<P>A new reflection array is created, by default the name TEST is
used. The array contains integer numbers, by default 1 signifies that
the reflection will be used for cross-validation (i.e. excluded from
refinement). The output of the <TT>make_cv.inp</TT> task file is a CNS
formatted reflection file. This will contain a header which describes
the data items in the file, followed by the data items themselves. The
file is plain ASCII and can be viewed with any text viewer/editor.
Example header from a CNS reflection file with cross validation
information:</P>

<PRE>
 NREFlection=     25615
 ANOMalous=FALSe { equiv. to HERMitian=TRUE}
 DECLare NAME=FOBS                   DOMAin=RECIprocal   TYPE=REAL END
 DECLare NAME=SIGMA                  DOMAin=RECIprocal   TYPE=REAL END
 DECLare NAME=TEST                   DOMAin=RECIprocal   TYPE=INTE END
 INDE     0    0    3 FOBS=  1047.380 SIGMA=    18.630 TEST=         0
 INDE     0    0    6 FOBS=   197.360 SIGMA=     2.980 TEST=         0
 INDE     0    0    7 FOBS=   451.840 SIGMA=     4.920 TEST=         0
 INDE     0    0    8 FOBS=   410.340 SIGMA=     4.270 TEST=         1
 INDE     0    0    9 FOBS=   666.420 SIGMA=     8.190 TEST=         0
</PRE>

<P>The phase information to be used in the refinement will be the
Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients obtained from MAD phasing (see other
tutorials). It is sufficient to just add the output .hkl file, from
the final MAD phasing job, to the list of reflection files read into
the CNS task files. It is important to list this file last if the
other reflections files do not contain anomalous data.</P>

<P>In some cases the experimental phases will have come from a
different program and therefore will be in a different format. If the
format is plain text then an awk or perl script can usually be written
to convert to CNS format. For binary files such as the CCP4 MTZ format
a special program will be required to convert to CNS format. There are
2 such programs for this (both of which are part of CCP4 version 3.5):</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>SFTOOLS:</B> This can read an MTZ file then write it back out
in CNS format. All items will be correctly converted. However, the
header information from the CNS file is not written. This must be
added manually. The header for a file with experimental phase
information should look something like this:
<PRE>
 NREFlection=           1400
 ANOMalous=TRUE { equiv. to HERMitian=FALSe}
 DECLare NAME=FOBS        DOMAin=RECIprocal   TYPE=COMP END
 DECLare NAME=SIGMA       DOMAin=RECIprocal   TYPE=REAL END
 DECLare NAME=PA          DOMAin=RECIprocal   TYPE=REAL END
 DECLare NAME=PB          DOMAin=RECIprocal   TYPE=REAL END
 DECLare NAME=PC          DOMAin=RECIprocal   TYPE=REAL END
 DECLare NAME=PD          DOMAin=RECIprocal   TYPE=REAL END
 GROUp TYPE=HL
   OBJEct=PA
   OBJEct=PB
   OBJEct=PC
   OBJEct=PD
 END
 INDE     0    4    2 FOBS=     677.8       0.0 SIGMA=     19.40
                      PA=    -0.486 PB=     0.000 PC=     0.000 PD=     0.000

The grouping for the HL coefficients is essential in order that
remapping of reflections to a different asymmetric unit is performed
correctly.</LI>

<LI><B>mtz2various:</B> This can read an MTZ file and write out a CNS
reflection file. An example script is:
<PRE>
mtz2various HKLIN infile HKLOUT outfile << EOF
RESOLUTION 10000 2
OUTPUT CNS
EXCLUDE SIGP 0.001   # to exclude unmeasured refl.
LABIN FP=Fnat SIGFP=SIGnat PHIB=PHI FOM=FOMM HLA=HLA HLB=HLB HLC=HLC HLD=HLD
END
EOF

<P>In some cases the experimental phase information is only available
in the form of centroid phases and figures-of-merit (FOM). These must
be converted to Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients in order to be used
in refinement in CNS. The CNS task file <TT>make_hlcoeff.inp</TT> can
be used for this purpose.</P>

<P>In general it is best to use the "raw" experimental phase
information, i.e. no density modification or other phase improvement
methods have been used. Density modified phases usually have inflated
FOM estimates which will lead to their over-weighting with the MLHL
target in refinement. Therefore, if density modified phases are to be
used it may be wise to "blur" the probability distributions by the
application of a scale factor and B-factor. The CNS task file
<TT>hlcoeff_blur.inp</TT> can be used for this purpose.</P>

<P>It is a good idea to check that the electron density map generated
from these experimental phases after conversion to CNS format is
unchanged and that the model coincides with the density. The CNS task
file <TT>fourier_map.inp</TT> can be used to make a Fourier synthesis
using the observed amplitudes and the experimental Hendrickson-Lattman
coefficients.</P>
