<H2>Checking the initial model</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>
   
<P>The model has been obtained by manual building, and therefore may
have distorted geometry so it is sensible to check the model prior to
starting refinement. In this example the CNS task file
<TT>model_stats_start.inp</TT> is used to analyze the model geometry
and diffraction statistics. The results will indicate if the model has
poor geometry which can occur in the course of manual rebuilding or
also due to an error at the generate stage (see previous
section). Locating any possible problems prior to refinement will save
time later on. </P>
<P>Note that we leave the molecular topology file blank so we use the coordinate file to automatically generate the molecular topology. There are two chain breaks in the initial model (the density was
  too poor to build these sections). The automatic molecular topology generation will automatically
  identify chain breaks (on the basis of distance) and remove the
peptide linkage at the break point. </P>
<P>Note that we are reading the experimental (MAD) phases that are stored in the file <tt>mad_phase2.hkl</tt> after the file that contains the native data plus test array for cross-validation <tt>nsf.cv </tt>(the <tt>model_stats_start.inp</tt> file is taken from the <tt>model_stats.inp</tt> input file, i.e., the only differences are the particular input parameter settings): </P>

<p>To make sure that the automatic molecular topology generation performed normally, have a look at the output file (model_stats_start.out) and search for &quot;automatically generating molecular topology&quot;. You find:</p>

  Note the two messages that links have been removed between residues 213,217 and 248,254.  These are the two chain breaks that it correctly identified.</p>
<p>The output listing file (<A

<P>Initial R-values:</P>

<PRE>
=================================== summary ==================================

resolution range: 500 - 1.9 A<br>  R-values:<br>  initial                                        r= 0.4634 free_r= 0.4451<br>  after B-factor and/or bulk solvent correction  r= 0.3692 free_r= 0.3757</PRE>

<P>Initial R-values that are very different from expected are usually
the result of a simple mistake such as incorrect space group, unit
cell dimensions, input diffraction data or input model.</P>

<P>This distribution of R-values is reasonable - there is no dramatic
increase in R-value (in particular free R-value) as resolution
increases. If there were resolution shells with R-values significantly
higher than the rest this might indicate possible problems with the
data processing (ice rings for example). However, the R-values
indicate the fit to the experimental data and should not be
manipulated by removing data - in particular by the use of sigma
cutoffs to exclude weak data.</P>

<P>Specific problems with the model geometry can be identified
here. In particular the deviations for the bond lengths should be
checked. If there are very long bond lengths the model should be
checked. This can occur as a result of a mistake at the generate
stage, in particular forgetting to include a TER or BREAK card between
separate chains. If present, these unphysical bonds will cause serious
problems in refinement.</P>

<P>Non-trans peptide bonds:</P>

<PRE>
============================ non-trans peptides ==============================

distorted peptide: segid=  resid= 143 resname=PRO<br>                   current dihedral value=  -68.354<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this may require correction before starting refinement</PRE>

<P>The presence of non-trans peptides, unless they are proline
residues, will cause problems in refinement. They can be identified,
and an appropriate parameter file created using the CNS task file
<TT>general/cis_peptide.inp</TT>. The parameter file generated is read
into subsequent refinement task files.</P>
