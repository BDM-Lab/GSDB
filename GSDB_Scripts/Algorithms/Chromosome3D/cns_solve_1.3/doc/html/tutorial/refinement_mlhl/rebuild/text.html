<H2>Rebuilding followed by refinement</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>The free R-value of the model has now dropped to 30.3%. Inspection
of the electron density map followed by manual rebuilding is now
performed to improve the model. A cross-validated, sigma-A weighted,
phase combined 2Fo-Fc map is calculated. Inspection of the phase-combined 2Fo-Fc map produced by the previous refinement round (see files <tt>refine_atp_2.hkl </tt>and <tt>refine_atp_2_2fofc.map</tt>) shows

that the map is in general very good - the density clearly matches the
model. However, there are regions which were not built initially which
show traceable density:</P>

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER>
  <TR>
<TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="2fofc.jpeg"
    HEIGHT=340 WIDTH=429></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=CENTER>Sigma-A weighted, phase combined 2Fo-Fc map (at 1.5 sigma).<BR>
                 Continuous density is seen for residues 249 to 253.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The model is manually rebuilt in this region to add the missing
residues 214 to 216 and 249 to 253 resulting in a new set of
coordinates. These coordinates are then used to make new CNS
coordinate and molecular topology files for further refinement (only change compared to the previous <tt>refine_atp_2.inp</tt> file are the input coordinate file name and the output root name) (the <tt>refine_reb.inp</tt> file is taken from the <tt>refine.inp</tt> input file, i.e., the only differences are the particular input parameter settings):</P>
