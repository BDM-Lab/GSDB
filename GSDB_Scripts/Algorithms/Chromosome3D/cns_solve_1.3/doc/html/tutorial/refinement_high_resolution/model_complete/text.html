<H2>Locating missing parts of the model</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>The <TT>refine.inp</TT> task file that was run in the previous section produced sigma-A weighted 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps:</P>
<PRE>
      refine_fofc.map
      refine_2fofc.map</PRE>
<P>These maps can be directly displayed with Coot. They can also be displayed with PyMOL when renaming the &quot;.map&quot; extension to &quot;.xplor&quot;. Alternatively, they can be converted for to &quot;omap&quot; files for display with <tt>O</tt>, by using the command</P>
<PRE>
      map_to_omap *.map
</PRE>
<p>to convert the CNS maps to a format which can be read into <tt>O (you must hav</tt>e <tt>mapman</tt> installed<tt>)</tt>. </p>
<p>Finally, the <TT>refine.inp</TT> task file produced a file with the extension &quot;.hkl&quot;:</p>
<PRE>      refine.hkl
</PRE>
<p>This is a CNS structure factor file that contains the Fourier coefficients of both the 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps. It can be read directly with Coot, by going to -&gt; File -&gt; Auto OpenMTZ (even though it is not an MTZ file). In addition to these map files, the <TT>refine.inp</TT> task file also produces files with the extension &quot;.peals&quot;. These contain sorted lists of the positive and negative peaks in the respective electron density maps. Finally, the real space R (RSR) values and real space correlation coefficients (RSCC) are provide in <tt>refine_rsr.list</tt> and <tt>refine_rsr.pdb</tt>. The latter coordinate file contains the refined coordinates, but with the B-factor array set to the RSR values. This enables coloring of atoms by RSR, for example in PyMOL using the spectrum B option.</p>
<P>The Fo-Fc map shows 4 outstanding peaks (all above 20 sigma). These are
  clearly separated from the other difference density peaks in the
  map. This can be seen both by visual inspection of the map but also in
  the positive density peak list generated
  (model_map_fofc_positive.peaks). This peak list (which is in PDB
format) is used to add the ytterbiums to the model.</P>

<P>The positive peak list:</P>

<P>The electron density map:</P>

<P>In order to generate a new model with the ytterbium ions included
we can merge the coordinates for the current model and the outstanding
peaks from the peaks list. The atoms name, residue name and chain id
for the ytterbium ions must be changed manually in order to give them unique resids and/or segids. In this case the end of the new
coordinate file looks like this:</P>

<P>Note that the atom name has been changed to YB+3 and the residue
name to YB3, these are the appropriate names for a ytterbium 3+
ion. This information can be obtained from the CNS topology file
CNS_TOPPAR:ion.top. The chain identifier has been changed to Y. It is
not necessary to include a segid because the program will take any specified chainid and use it as the segid. This coordinate file (mbp+yb) is then
used for further refinement using the <TT>refine.inp</TT> task file.. It is especially important to
first obtain reasonable estimates for the ytterbium ion
B-factors. Compared to the previous section, we do not perform annealing  since the model has not undergone a major change (apart from adding the ytterbiums). The <tt>refine_yb.inp</tt> file is taken from the <tt>refine.inp</tt> input file, i.e., the only differences are the particular input parameter settings.</P>
