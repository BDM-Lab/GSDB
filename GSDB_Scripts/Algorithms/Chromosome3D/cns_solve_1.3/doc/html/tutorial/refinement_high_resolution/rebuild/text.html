<H2>Rebuilding followed by refinement</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>The free R-value of the model has now dropped to 31% (the
ytterbiums contribute significantly to the scattering). Inspection of
the electron density map followed by manual rebuilding is now
performed to improve the model. A cross-validated, sigma-A weighted
2Fo-Fc map is calculated by the<TT> refine_yb.inp</TT> task in the previous section. Inspection of this map will help locate
areas of the model which are in error. It would also be helpful to
look at a difference map (at both positive and negative contour) at
the same time.The map is in general very good - the density clearly matches the
  model. However, there is a region where there is an obvious difference
between the model and the electron density:</P>

                 A discrepancy is seen between the model and density around residue B117.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>In order to obtain less biased density for this region a simulated
annealing omit map is calculated. We will omit the first 10 residues
from molecule B (residues B109 to B118). Residues immediately
surrounding these will also be omitted (this is done by selecting a 3.5 A neighborhood around these atoms). Furthermore, we apply harmonic positional restraints to atoms surrounding the omitted region. This is done with the <TT>sa_omit_map.inp</TT> task file starting from the refine_yb.pdb of the previous section, and specifying the following atom selections (note that we use Cartesian dynamics to avoid potential problems with the torsion angle topology generator if the omitted atoms break certain bonds):</P>
<P>A single round of simulated annealing refinement is
  performed to attempt to remove model bias to the missing region. </P>

<P>The
  result is an electron density map.The map shows improved density for the correct placement of the
N-terminal residues. There is a register shift of one residue
resulting in a more open loop:</P>

                 The correct trace for the N-terminal residues in molecule B are clearer.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The model is manually rebuilt in this region resulting in a new set
of coordinates, called &quot;mbp_o.pdb&quot;. These coordinates are then used for another refinement round using the <TT>refine.inp</TT> task file. We will use two cycles of simulated annealing, minimization, and B-factor refinement which will
correct any errors introduced by the manual rebuilding and optimize
the fit of the retraced region. As before a start temperature of 3000K
is used. The <tt>refine_reb.inp</tt> file is taken from the <tt>refine.inp</tt> input file, i.e., the only differences are the particular input parameter settings.</P>

<P>At this point the free R-value is around 30.4% (and the R-value
is around 27%). The model still might have some misplaced atoms
(side chain atoms or small loops) but inspection of the maps suggest
that the majority of the structure is correct. The resulting coordinates are in <tt>refine_reb.inp</tt>, the electron density maps are in <tt>refine_reb_2fofc.map</tt>, <tt>refine_reb_fofc.map</tt>, <tt>refine_reb.hkl</tt>. Real space R values and correlation coefficients are in <tt>refine_reb_rsr.list</tt> and <tt>refine_reb_rsr.pdb</tt>.</P>
