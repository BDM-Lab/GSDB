<H2>Initial refinement by rigid body, simulated annealing, positional minimization, and B-factor refinement</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>The refinement is begun with rigid body refinement, which is
important if the initial model has come from molecular replacement. This step can generally be omitted if the model has been obtained by fitting into an electron density map. The
positions of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit is optimized
using the CNS task file rigid.inp. In this example 2 cycles of 20
steps are performed to ensure convergence. This can be important if
the model is a significant distance from the correct position.</P>

<P>The result of the rigid body refinement is a new coordinate file
(rigid.pdb). In the majority of CNS refinement task files information
about the refinement procedure is written out at the top of the output

<P>This information provides a summary of the refinement and also a
record of the input data and parameters used to generate this
structure.</P>

<P>Following rigid body refinement, simulated annealing using torsion
angle dynamics is used to improve the model. The use of torsion angle
dynamics reduces the number of parameters being refined and hence
reduces the degree of overfitting of the data. For an initial model
with relatively large errors (due to manual building or misplaced
atoms) a starting temperature of 3000-5000K is recommended. For a longer slow-cooling period, the cooling rate can be
decreased from 50K to 25K. The general <TT>refine.inp</TT> refinement task
file includes energy minimization both before and after the simulated
annealing, as well as B-factor refinement after simulated annealing. The process is repeated for the specified number of refinement cycles (in this case 2 cycles). It is recommended to use the general <TT>refine.inp</TT> refinement task
file for all types of refinement except rigid body refinement.</P>
<P>The initial model has the same B-factor for all atoms. In order to
take account of the possible variation in B-factors throughout the
model, B-factors are then refined. The default is restrained B-factor refinement which is generally reasonably for diffraction data sets better than 3.5 A. For lower resolution data sets, group B-factor refinements shall be used. </P>
<P>The  refinement is performed
  with the CNS task file <TT>refine.inp</TT>:</P>
<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="refine.inp">refine.inp</A> &gt; refine.out
</PRE>

<P>It is generally advisable to perform 5-10 repeats of the annealing refinement with different seeds that determine the initial random velocities for the molecular dynamics simulations. This can be easily done by setting up a <TT>C shell</TT> script file that modifies the CNS <TT>refine.inp</TT> task file. A particular example is:</P>
<PRE>
      ./<a href="refine.csh">refine.csh</a> 1</PRE>
<p>This  script changes the seed in the <TT>refine.inp</TT> file to 1, changes the output_root to &quot;refine_1&quot;,  saves the modified file to <TT>refine_1.inp</TT>, and then runs the job. Multiple such scripts can be run to perform multiple jobs (e.g., <tt>./refine.csh 2</tt>). This approach of multiple independent jobs is particularly powerful in a distributed computing environment. Generally, the coordinates with the lowest Rfree should be used for further analysis. </p>
<h3>Sorting the best structures obtained from multiple independent refinements</h3>
<p>The refined coordinates from multiple independent refinements should be sorted with respect to Rfree. We use a Perl script to do this:<br>
  <br>
</p>
<pre>      .<a href="sort.pl">/sort.pl</a> refine_*.pdb &gt; sort.list<br>
</pre>
<br>
This Perl script creates a new directory &quot;sorted&quot; that contains the final coordinates and the corresponding Fourier coefficient map files (*.hkl files) sorted by Rfree, i.e., sorted/sort_1.pdb is the best coordinate set, the one with the lowest Rfree, and sorted/sorted_1.hkl is the corresponding Fourier coefficient file.  The  script also produces a convenient summary:<br>
<br>
<a href="sort.list"><br>
</a>
<pre>
sort.list
</pre>
<h3>B-factor sharpening of electron density maps</h3>
<p>B-factor sharpening of the electron density maps produced by <tt>refine.inp</tt> can be accomplished in several ways. First, the electron density map files (<tt>refine*.map</tt>) can be read by Coot (see also <a href="../model_complete/text.html">Next Section</a> for other methods to display electron density maps) and then B-factor sharpened using Calculate -&gt; Map Sharpening. This method also works when reading the CNS structure factor file that contains the coefficients for the 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps (<tt>refine.hkl</tt>) into Coot using File -&gt; Auto OpenMTZ. Second, the CNS structure factor file <tt>refine.hkl </tt>can be read by the CNS <tt>fourier_map.inp</tt> script and B-factor sharpening applied upon computing electron density maps (the coefficients for the Fo-Fc map are in the array called F1, the coefficients for the 2Fo-Fc map are in the array F2).</p>
<h3>Averaging electron density maps obtained from multiple independent refinements</h3>
<p>The electron density maps resulting form these multiple refinement runs can be averaged by using the <tt>model_map.inp</tt> script file:</p>
<PRE>      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="model_map.inp">model_map.inp</A> &gt; model_map.out
</PRE>
<p>In this case, we obtain an averaged map computed from the coordinates <tt>refine_1.pdb</tt> and <tt>refine_2.pdb</tt>. See the next section for hints how to display the resulting electron density maps. This type of averaging can be very powerful to improve model phases (L. M. Rice, P. D. Adams, Y. Shamoo, and A. T. Brunger, Phase improvement by multi-start simulated annealing refinement and structure factor averaging, J. Appl. Crystallography 31, 798-805, 1998). The <tt>model_map.inp</tt> script file also has an option for B-factor sharpening. </p>
<h3>Use of non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) information</h3>
<P>Note that because there is a dimer in the asymmetric unit we could
  use non-crystallographic symmetry as a restraint in the refinement
  (see the tutorial <a href="../../using_ncs/restrain/text.html">Using NCS Restraints in Refinement</a>). NCS should be used if possible, especially if the resolution
  of the data is limited (worse than 2.5A). For example, if we re-run the refinement job above in the presence of NCS restraints (the <tt>refine_ncs.inp</tt> file is taken from the <tt>refine.inp</tt> input file, i.e., the only differences are the particular input parameter settings): </P>
<PRE>      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="refine_ncs.inp">refine_ncs.inp</A> &gt; refine_ncs.out
</PRE>

<P>This first round of refinement has reduced the free R-value from
  43% to 39%. The next step is to locate any major part of the model
which is currently missing (see the next section).</P>
