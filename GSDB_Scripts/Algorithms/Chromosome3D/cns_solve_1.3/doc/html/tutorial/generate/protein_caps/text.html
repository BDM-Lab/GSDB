<h2>A heterotrimer with N-terminal acetyl and C-terminal amide capping
    groups, a chlorine ion and water molecules</h2>

<HR>

This tutorial shows how to generate a molecular topology file
(<tt>.mtf</tt>) and a <tt>CNS</tt> coordinate file (<tt>.pdb</tt>)
using the <tt>generate.inp</tt> task file, starting with a standard
coordinate file as obtained from the <tt>PDB</tt>.

<p>

The structure with the <tt>PDB</tt> ID code
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1BB1"
><tt>1bb1</tt></a> is
a heterotrimer with a few particularities:

<ul>
<li>The protein chains have N-terminal acetyl and C-terminal amide
    capping groups. These groups require the use of custom
    topology and parameter files. The files <tt>capping.top</tt>,
    <tt>capping.param</tt> and <tt>protein_capping.link</tt>
    from <a href="../capping/text.html">another tutorial</a> are used.

<p>

<li>The original PDB file includes coordinates for a chlorine ion.
    This requires the use of the standard topology and parameter
    files <tt>ion.top</tt> and <tt>ion.param</tt>.

<p>

<li>The original PDB files includes coordinates for a number of
    water molecules.
    This requires the use of the standard topology and parameter
    files <tt>water.top</tt> and <tt>water.param</tt>.

<p>

<li>Some atoms are missing from five residues (residue identifier
    15 in chain B, residue identifiers 2, 9, 29, and 34 in chain C).

</ul>

<hr>

To conform to the naming conventions adopted in the creation of
<tt>capping.top</tt>, <tt>capping.param</tt> and
<tt>protein_capping.link</tt>, a few simple modification must be
made to the original <tt>PDB</tt> file:

<ul>

<li>The original residue name for the amide group is <tt>NH2</tt> and
    has to be renamed to <tt>NHH</tt>.

<p>

<li>The original name for the terminal carbon of the acetyl group is
    <tt>CH3</tt> and has to be renamed to <tt>CA</tt>.

</ul>

<hr>

The <tt>generate.inp</tt> task files also needs to be modified:

<ul>
<li>The correct name for the <strong>protein coordinate file</strong>
    must be defined (<a href="1bb1.pdb"><tt>1bb1.pdb</tt></a>).

<p>

<li>The original <tt>PDB</tt> file (like most <tt>PDB</tt> files) does
    not use segment identifiers (columns 73-76), but only the
    one-character chain identifiers (column 22). However, <tt>CNS</tt>
    only uses segment identifiers, and chain identifiers are not used.
    Therefore it is necessary to convert the chain identifiers to
    segment identifiers. This is requested by setting the flag labeled
    <strong>convert chainid to segid if chainid is non-blank</strong>
    to <tt>true</tt>.

<p>

<li>Because of the presence of the capping groups, the customized
    linkage file <tt>protein_capping.link</tt> must be used in addition to the standard library file <tt>CNS_TOPPAR:protein.link</tt>.

    <p>

<li>The topology and parameter files for the capping groups are
    defined as additional <strong> topology and parameter
  files</strong>.
</ul>

In <tt>generate.inp</tt>, the standard library topology and parameter
files for ions and water molecules are included by default. Please note
that most parameter files are not included by default in the refinement
task files. In general, the user has to take care that all the
necessary parameter files are included.

<p>

The command to generate the files <tt>generate_easy.mtf</tt> and
<tt>generate_easy.pdb</tt> is:

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="generate_easy.inp">generate_easy.inp</A> &gt; generate_easy.out
</PRE>

In the output file <tt>generate_easy.pdb</tt>, any missing atoms mentioned
above are excluded, i.e., the selection to build atoms is set to &quot;(none)&quot;. The task file can build unknown atoms by specifying &quot;(not known)&quot;. This feature should be used with caution and the resulting structure carefully checked. <br>
<p>
  
  Inspection of the <tt>generate_easy.pdb</tt> output file shows that the
  first character of the <tt>CNS</tt> segment identifier is also used as
  chain identifier.  In <tt>CNS</tt>, segment identifiers can be up to
  four characters long.  This means, it would be possible to use, for
  example, the identifiers <tt>ION</tt> and <tt>WAT</tt> instead of just
  <tt>I</tt> and <tt>W</tt>. However, many other programs (including the
  graphics program <tt>O</tt>) can only handle the one-character chain
  identifiers and ignore the segment identifiers. For compatibility, it
  is therefore frequently much more convenient to use only one-character
  segment identifiers.
