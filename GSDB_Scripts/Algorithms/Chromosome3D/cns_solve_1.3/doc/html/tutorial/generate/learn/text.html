<H2>Learning parameters from coordinates</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>This facility can be used to obtain bond, bond angle, dihedral
angle, or improper angle equilibrium parameters and energy constants
from selected atoms of Cartesian coordinate sets. The coordinates are
specified in the main coordinate set. The statement learns parameters
only for those interaction terms that are turned on by the flags
statement. The learned parameters will take precedence over the
type-based parameters.</P>

<P>The equilibrium geometry parameters can be directly obtained from a
single coordinate set or averaged over successive coordinate
sets. If just a single coordinate set is available, one can learn only
the equilibrium geometry, not the energy constants. If an ensemble of
coordinates is available, energy constants can be derived assuming
equipartition of energy among the different internal coordinates. This
is only approximately verified in a real system, since there is
actually coupling among the internal coordinates.</P>

<PRE>
  k_bond     = (kT)/( 2 &lt;(r-&lt;r&gt;)^2&gt; )
  k_angle    = (kT)/( 2 &lt;(q-&lt;q&gt;)^2&gt; )
  k_dihedral = (kT)/( 2 &lt;(f-&lt;f&gt;)^2&gt; )
</PRE>

<P>The brackets represent an average over the ensemble of coordinate
sets. kT/2 is the mean thermal energy per harmonic degree of freedom
at T=298K. The last expression assumes that all dihedral angles and
torsion angles are represented by a harmonic functional form with
periodicity n set to zero. In fact, the learn facility will set the
periodicity of all "learned" dihedral and improper angles to zero. In
the case that one of the variances in the denominators becomes zero,
the corresponding energy constant is set to 999999. Parameter learning
is not possible for nonbonded parameters.</P>

<P>The possible learn statements are as follows:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>INITiate { learn-options }</B> initializes selected parameters
for the learning process.</LI>

<LI><B>ACCUmulate</B> includes data from the current main coordinate
set in the running averages.</LI>

<LI><B>TERMinate</B> calculates final averages.</LI>

</UL>

<P>The possible learn options are as follows:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>SELEction=selection</B> learns atom-based parameters for
specified atoms. All atoms of a particular interaction term (bond,
bond angle, dihedral angle, improper angle) have to be selected in
order for the parameters for that term to be learned (default:
(ALL)).</LI>

<LI><B>MODE=STATistics | NOSTatistics</B> specifies whether energy
constants are to be learned. The energy constants will be learned if
STATistics is specified; otherwise the energy constants will be
untouched (default: STATistics).</LI>

</UL>

<P>It is important that the learn options be specified in the
initialization stage:</P>

<PRE>
  learn initiate selection=( name c* ) MODE=STATistics end 
  learn accumulate end 
  learn terminate  end 
</PRE>

<U>Requirements</U>

<P>The atom selection is fragile.</P>

<U>Example: Learning Unknown Equilibrium Parameters from Coordinates</U>

<P>In the following example, a protein and ligand are considered. The
molecular structure of the the protein and the ligand have to be
generated as outlined previously. The ligand requires the creation of a topology file that needs to be read by the CNS task file:</P>

<PRE>   autogenerate angles=true dihedrals=false end 

   residue LIGA 
      atom A type=C end 
      atom B type=C end 
      atom C type=C end 
      atom D type=O end 

      bond A B 
      bond B C 
      bond C D 

     improper A B C D 

   end </PRE>
<p><br>
  Note that mass statements may be required if the atom types of the<br>
  ligand are non-standard.We assume that the residue name as it appears in the coordinate file is LIGA.</p>
<P>The protein parameters can be obtained from one of CNS's protein
  parameter files. In general, the ligand parameters will be
  unknown. Suppose that the ligand coordinates are known from an
  appropriate crystal structure. We can learn the unknown ligand
  parameters from the known Cartesian coordinates. For purposes of
  structure determination, it is usually sufficient to set the energy
constants to a uniform value.</P>

<P>The following statements define the unknown ligand parameters. They
could be read as a parameter file into any CNS task file:.</P>

<PRE>
   learn initiate sele=(segid LIGA) mode=nostatistics end 
   learn accumulate end 
   learn terminate end 

   BOND   (segid LIGA) (segid LIGA) 400. TOKEN 
   ANGLE  (segid LIGA) (segid LIGA) (segid LIGA) 60. TOKEN 
   IMPR  (segid LIGA) (segid LIGA) (segid LIGA) (segid LIGA) 50. TOKEN TOKEN 

   {* Set the nonbonded parameters (only if required). *}

   NBON ( (name A or name B or name C) and segid "LIGA" )  0.1 3.5 0.1 3.5 
   NBON ( name D and segid "LIGA" )  0.1 3.4 0.1 3.4 

</PRE>
<P>Note that the learn statement automatically sets the periodicity of
all learned dihedral and improper angles to zero. Also note that the
user has to specify improper and dihedral angles in the topology
definition of the ligand in order to maintain planarity and chirality
in certain parts of the ligand. Nonbonded parameters may have to be
set by appropriate parameter statements unless they are already
defined through type-based parameters. Finally, one has to activate
the nonbonded energy terms and any other energy terms that might be
needed, using the flags statement.</P>

<U>Example: Learning Atom-based Parameters from an Ensemble of Structures</U>

<P>The learn statement is used to derive equilibrium geometries and
energy constants simultaneously from a thermal ensemble of ten
coordinate files:</P>

<PRE>
{* Only the active energy terms are affected by the learn statement.* } 

flags exclude * include bonds angles dihedrals impropers end 

{* Initiate the learning process. *} 

parameters 
   learn initiate sele=(all) mode=statistics end 
end 

{* Loop through the ensemble of coordinates. *} 

for $filename in ( "a1.pdb" "a2.pdb" "a3.pdb" "a4.pdb" "a5.pdb" 
                   "a6.pdb" "a7.pdb" "a8.pdb" "a9.pdb" "a10.pdb" ) loop main 

    coordinates @@$filename 

    parameters 
       learn accumulate end 
    end 

end loop main   

{* Now we terminate the learning process. *} 

parameters 
   learn terminate end 
end </PRE>
<p><br>
One can now reduce the parameters to type-based parameters and write them to a file:</p>
<pre>parameters
   reduce
end</pre>
<pre>write parameters output=&quot;learned.param&quot; end</pre>
<pre>stop</pre>
