<h2>Creation of topology and parameter files for
N-terminal acetyl and C-terminal amide capping groups</h2>

<HR>

Some proteins have capping groups at the termini. At the N-terminus,
this can be an acetyl group, and at the C-terminus an amide group.

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="aa_capped.gif" WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="148"></center>
<p>

There are two ways of introducing capping groups in <tt>CNS</tt>.  One
way is to apply a patch to a terminus to add the atoms of the capping
group.  In this case the terminal residue including the capping group
is treated as one unit. The residue name is still that of the standard
amino acid.  This solution works well as long as all the work is done
in <tt>CNS</tt>.  However, if the <tt>CNS</tt> <tt>PDB</tt> file is
used in another program (for example <tt>O</tt>), the additional atoms
can cause problems.  Alternatively, a new residue type can be defined
for each capping group.  This approach causes less problems when using
the <tt>CNS</tt> <tt>PDB</tt> file in other programs. In the following,
the creation of three types of files for the definition of new residue
types is outlined:

<p>

<table border=1>
<tr><TD VALIGN=top><tt><A HREF="capping.top">capping.top</A></tt>
    <TD VALIGN=top>This <strong>topology file</strong> defines the atoms
        in each capping group, the bonds, angles, dihedrals and impropers,
        and methods for linking each group to a protein chain.
<tr><TD VALIGN=top><a href="capping.param"><tt>capping.param</tt></a>
    <TD VALIGN=top>This <strong>parameter file</strong>
        defines the target values
        and weights for the bonds, angles, dihedrals and impropers
        defined in the topology file.

                       >protein_capping.link</A></tt>
    <TD VALIGN=top>This <strong>linkage file</strong> defines how the
        linkage methods defined in the topology file are used.

<h3>Important remark</h3>

This tutorial outlines how to create topology and parameter files for
two very simple chemical groups. The definition of the topology given
here is more or less unambiguous and complete. However, the
corresponding parameter definitions are only syntactically correct. The
specific target values and weights are copied from corresponding
definitions in the standard parameter file <tt>protein_rep.param</tt>
and therefore certainly not ideal. One reason for this shortcoming is
that it is in general very time consuming to obtain a consistent set of
parameters.  Another reason is that the ideal set of parameters also
depends on the context in which it is used.  Parameters used in
refinement against X-ray data tend to be different from parameters used
in refinement against NMR data or free Molecular Dynamics simulations.
The parameters shown in the examples below are probably sufficient for
use in refinement against good X-ray data, but not suitable for
free Molecular Dynamics simulations.


<HR>

<h3>Definition of the topology for the amide capping group</h3>

The topology definiton for the amide group involves just one atom:

<blockquote>
<pre>
mass  NHHE  16.02270 ! extended atom nitrogen with two hydrogen

residue NHH
  group
    atom N   type=NHHE  charge=0.00  end
end
</pre>
</blockquote>

In the standard topology file <tt>protein.top</tt> used for refinement
against X-ray data, only some hydrogen are explicitly included.
Following this approach, the hydrogen for the amide group are not
specified explicitly. Instead, an <em>extended atom type</em>
<tt>NHHE</tt> is defined with the sum of the masses of one nitrogen and
two hydrogen. The name of the new residue type is chosen as <tt>NHH</tt>.
When a structure is generated from a <tt>PDB</tt> file, the name of the
nitrogen in the amide group must be <tt>N</tt>. No charge is specified,
because charges are not normally used in crystallographic refinement.

<p>

The second part of the topology definition for the amide capping group
specifies methods for linking the group to a protein chain.  Two
methods are required, one for proline, and another for all the other
amino acids.

<blockquote>
<pre>
presidue NHHL { link for all amino acids except proline }
  add bond -C +N

  add angle -CA -C +N
  add angle -O  -C +N

  add improper  -C -CA +N -O  {planar -C}
end


presidue NHHP  { link for proline }
 add bond -C +N

 add angle -CA -C +N
 add angle -O  -C +N

 add dihedral  -N -CA -C +N

 add improper  -C -CA +N -O  {planar -C}
end
</pre>
</blockquote>

The two <tt>presidue</tt> definitions are based on the <tt>PEPT</tt>
and <tt>PEPP</tt> definitions in the standard topology file
<tt>protein.top</tt>. The plus and minus signs are used to distinguish
the atoms in the two residues to be linked. The <tt>add bond -C +N</tt>
statement defines a bond from the atom with the name <tt>C</tt> in the
&quot;previous&quot; residue to the atom with the name <tt>N</tt> in
the &quot;next&quot; residue in the peptide chain. The angle, dihedral
and improper definitions are a subset of the <tt>PEPT</tt> and
<tt>PEPP</tt> definitions.  All statements involving atoms in the
&quot;next&quot; residue other than <tt>N</tt> are omitted.

<hr>

<h3>Definition of the parameters for the amide capping group</h3>

All the topology definitions for <tt>NHH</tt> involve a new atom type,
<tt>NHHE</tt>. Therefore new parameters must be specified for
all interactions where <tt>NHHE</tt> takes part.

<blockquote>
<pre>
bond C    NHHE 1342.404  1.328 ! same as C    NH2

angle CH1E C    NHHE  863.744  116.900 ! same as CH1E C    N
angle CH2G C    NHHE  440.686  118.200 ! same as CH2G C    N
angle O    C    NHHE  991.543  122.000 ! same as N    C    O

evaluate ($vdw_radius_N=        3.0)                             {-0.1}
evaluate ($vdw_radius_N   = $vdw_radius_N    / 2^(1/6))
evaluate ($vdw_radius14_N   = $vdw_radius_N    -0.3/ 2^(1/6))
evaluate ($vdw_eps=0.1)
nonbonded  NHHE  $vdw_eps $vdw_radius_N  $vdw_eps $vdw_radius14_N ! same as NH2
</pre>
</blockquote>

For each topology definition, there must be a corresponding parameter
definition. However, in contrast to the topology definitions which are
based on atom names, the parameter definitions are type based.
Therefore one topology statement can require several parameter
statements.  This is, for example, the case for the topology statement
&quot;<tt>add angle -CA -C +N</tt>&quot;. In glycine, the <tt>CA</tt>
is defined with type <tt>CH2G</tt>, and in all other amino-acid
residues with type <tt>CH1E</tt>. Therefore there are two corresponding
parameter angle statements.

<p>

One might notice that there are no parameter definitions for the two
dihedral and improper definitions above (<tt>add dihedral -N -CA -C
+N</tt>, <tt>add improper -C -CA +N -O</tt>). This is because the
matching parameter statements in <tt>protein_rep.param</tt> use wildcards,
and therefore the type of the nitrogen is not important. The matching
parameter statements are:

<blockquote>
<pre>
dihe X    C    CH1E X       0.0       3       0.0 ! psi angle
evaluate ($kimpr_strong=750.0)
impr C    X    X    O     $kimpr_strong       0       0.0
</pre>
</blockquote>

It would be possible to override the wildcards with specific dihedral
and improper parameter statements. More details can be found in
the reference section.

<HR>

<h3>Definition of the topology for the acetyl capping group</h3>

The topology definiton for the acetyl group involves the addition
of three atoms and two bonds.

<blockquote>
<pre>
residue ACE
  group
    atom CA   type=CH3E  charge=0.00  end
    atom C    type=C     charge=0.00  end
    atom O    type=O     charge=0.00  end

  bond C   CA
  bond C   O
end
</pre>
</blockquote>

For the sake of simplicity, pre-existing atom type definitions
from <tt>protein.top</tt> are used.

<p>

The second part of the topology definition for the acetyl capping group
specifies methods for linking the group to a protein chain. As before
for <tt>NHH</tt>, two methods are required, one for proline, and
another for all the other amino acids.

<blockquote>
<pre>
presidue ACEL { link for all amino acids except proline }
  add bond -C +N

  add angle -CA -C +N
  add angle -O  -C +N
  add angle -C  +N +CA
  add angle -C  +N +H

  add dihedral  -C +N +CA +C
  add dihedral  -CA -C +N +CA

  add improper  -C -CA +N -O  {planar -C}
  add improper  +N -C +CA +H  {planar +N}
end

presidue ACEP { link for proline }
 add bond -C +N

 add angle -CA -C +N
 add angle -O  -C +N
 add angle -C  +N +CA
 add angle -C  +N +CD

 add dihedral  -C +N +CA +C
 add dihedral  -CA -C +N +CA

 add improper  -C -CA +N -O  {planar -C}
 add improper  +N +CA +CD -C  {planar +N}
end
</pre>
</blockquote>

As for <tt>NHH</tt>, the two <tt>presidue</tt> definitions are based on
the <tt>PEPT</tt> and <tt>PEPP</tt> definitions in the standard
topology file <tt>protein.top</tt>. The only difference is that the
dihedral statements involving the nitrogen atom in the
&quot;previous&quot; residue are omitted.

<hr>

<h3>Definition of the parameters for the acetyl capping group</h3>

Since standard atom types were assigned to the carbon and oxygen of the
acetyl group, most parameters are already defined. It only remains
to define a new bond parameter, three angle parameters, and one
dihedral parameter.

<blockquote>
<pre>
bond C    CH3E 1000.000  1.507 ! distance from Corina

angle CH3E C    O     672.465  120.800 ! same as CH1E C    O
angle CH3E C    NH1   485.856  116.200 ! same as CH1E C    NH1
angle CH3E C    N     863.744  116.900 ! same as CH1E C    N

evaluate ($kdih_rigid=1250.0)
dihe CH3E C    N    CH1E  $kdih_rigid  2  180.0 ! same as H2E C    N    CH1E
</pre>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>Creation of the linkage file</h3>

<p>For proteins, the rules for applying the linking methods defined in the
  topology files are listed in the standard library file <tt>protein.link</tt>. To include the new rules for the acetyl and
amide groups, an additional link file is created for the capping groups: </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&nbsp;
</pre>
<pre>   link aceP    head - ace   tail + pro     end
   link aceP    head - ace   tail + cpr     end</pre>
<pre>   link aceL    head - ace   tail + ala   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + arg   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + asn   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + asp   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + cys   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + gln   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + glu   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + gly   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + hish  end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + his   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + ile   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + leu   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + lys   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + met   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + mse   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + m3l   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + phe   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + ser   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + thr   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + trp   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + tyr   end
   link aceL    head - ace   tail + val   end</pre>
<pre>   link nhhP    head - PRO   tail + nhh     end
   link nhhP    head - CPR   tail + nhh     end</pre>
<pre>   link nhhl    head - ala   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - arg   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - asn   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - asp   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - cys   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - gln   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - glu   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - gly   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - hish  tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - his   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - ile   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - leu   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - lys   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - met   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - mse   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - m3l   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - phe   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - ser   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - thr   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - trp   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - tyr   tail + nhh     end 
   link nhhl    head - val   tail + nhh     end </pre>
<pre>&nbsp;
</pre>
</blockquote>

The syntax for the link statements is:

<blockquote>
<pre>
link &lt;presidue-label&gt;  head &lt;patch-character&gt; &lt;residue-name&gt;
                       tail &lt;patch-character&gt; &lt;residue-name&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

In all the examples, the &lt;patch-character&gt; for the head is a
minus sign, the &lt;patch-character&gt; for the tail is a plus sign.
Other characters could be used but for chains minus and plus signs are
most intuitive.

Note that starting in CNS version 1.3 wildcards are not allowed anyore in link statements. 
<hr>

<h3>Using the new topology and parameter files</h3>

The use of the new topology and parameter files is demonstrated by
generating the molecular topology based on a simple <tt>PDB</tt> file.
The example file <tt>capping.pdb</tt> contains four &quot;chains&quot;,
each consisting of one amino-acid residue with the two capping groups.
To generate the molecular topology, the task file <tt>generate.inp</tt>
is modified. The protein input file name is set to <tt><A
HREF="capping.pdb">capping.pdb</A></tt>, the protein linkage file name
is redefined as <tt><A
HREF="protein_capping.link">protein_capping.link</A></tt>, and the
prosthetic group topology and parameter files are defined as <tt><A
HREF="capping.top">capping.top</A></tt> and <tt><A
HREF="capping.param">capping.param</A></tt>, respectively.  All other
parameters are unchanged.

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="generate.inp">generate.inp</A> &gt; generate.out
</PRE>
<p><br>
Instead of using the generate.inp task file, molecular topology file autogeneration can be used in many CNS task files. To use capping residues in these files, just add the <tt>capping.top</tt> to the list of topology files, <tt>capping.param</tt> to the list of parameter files, and <tt>protein_capping.link</tt> to the list of linkage files. </p>

<hr>

<h3>(Mis)using generate.inp error messages</h3>

When creating new topology and parameter files, it is often not easy to
figure out which additional bond, angle, dihedral and improper
parameters have to be defined. However, once the topology is defined
correctly, the error diagnostics produced when running
<tt>generat.inp</tt> can be (mis)used to find the missing parameter
definitions.

<p>

To demonstrate this, the files <tt>capping.pdb</tt> and
<tt>capping.param</tt> are copied to the files <tt>incomplete.pdb</tt>,
and <tt>incomplete.param</tt>, respectively.
<tt>incomplete.inp</tt> is a copy of the previously used file
<tt>generate.inp</tt> with the new file names for the <tt>PDB</tt> and
the parameter file.

<p>

Arbitrarily, a dihedral definition is deleted from <tt><A
HREF="incomplete.param">incomplete.param</A></tt>, and a gamma-carbon
from the cis-proline in <tt><A
HREF="incomplete.pdb">incomplete.pdb</A></tt>. The generate task file
<tt>incomplete.inp</tt> will now attempt to build this missing carbon
atom. For this it needs all the parameter definitions, and will
therefore produce error messages if some are missing.

<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="incomplete.inp">incomplete.inp</A> &gt; incomplete.out</PRE>

The error message at the end of <tt>incomplete.out</tt> is:

<pre>
 %CODDIH-ERR: missing dihedral parameters %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  dihedral energy constant missing.
  target dihedral value missing.
  periodicity missing.
  ATOM1: SEGId="C   ",  RESId="1   ",  NAME="CA  ",  CHEMical="CH3E"
  ATOM2: SEGId="C   ",  RESId="1   ",  NAME="C   ",  CHEMical="C   "
  ATOM3: SEGId="C   ",  RESId="2   ",  NAME="N   ",  CHEMical="N   "
  ATOM4: SEGId="C   ",  RESId="2   ",  NAME="CA  ",  CHEMical="CH1E"
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 %CODDIH-ERR: missing dihedral parameters %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  dihedral energy constant missing.
  target dihedral value missing.
  periodicity missing.
  ATOM1: SEGId="D   ",  RESId="1   ",  NAME="CA  ",  CHEMical="CH3E"
  ATOM2: SEGId="D   ",  RESId="1   ",  NAME="C   ",  CHEMical="C   "
  ATOM3: SEGId="D   ",  RESId="2   ",  NAME="N   ",  CHEMical="N   "
  ATOM4: SEGId="D   ",  RESId="2   ",  NAME="CA  ",  CHEMical="CH1E"
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 %CODDIH error encountered: program will be aborted.
</pre>

In general, there will only be error messages for one type of parameter
definition and it can be necessary to run the generate task file
several times before all the missing parameter definitions are found.
For example, first, only the missing bond parameters are shown. If they
are supplied and the generate task file is run again, the missing angle
parameters are listed, and so on for the dihedral, improper and
non-bonded parameter definitions.

<p>

It should be noted that a more elegant and rigorous way of generating
parameter definitions is by the use of the <tt>LEARN</tt> statement.
However, this requires well defined coordinates of several example
molecules. More details about the <tt>LEARN</tt> statement can be found
in <a href="../learn/text.html">another tutorial section</a>.
