<h2>Tools for building coordinates of hetero compounds</h2>

<HR>

<!-- http://sourceforge.net/projects/geostd/ -->
<P>The topology and parameter files for the acetyl and amide capping
groups shown in the previous tutorial were created without the
knowledge of atomic coordinates. This is only possible for very small
compounds. For the vast majority of hetero compounds, it is necessary
to know the atomic coordinates from which the topology and parameters
can then be derived.</P>

<P><B><U>Obtaining existing coordinates</U></B></P>
<p>In favorable cases, atomic coordinates for a given hetero compound, or
at least for a similar compound, can be found in the <a
href="http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org/" target="rcsb">PDB Ligand Expo</a>. The same compounds
are also available through other web sites, which are often easier to use.
Existing heterogens should be used whenever possible to keep consistent nomenclature.</P>

<P><a href="http://xray.bmc.uu.se/hicup" target="hicup">Gerard Kleywegt's HIC-UP server</a>
maintains reference coordinates and CNS topology and parameter files
for all heterogens in the PDB. It also provides numerous links and related information
about each compound. The parameters are generated using XPLO2D, and are <B>NOT</B> validated.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/chempdb" target="ebi">EBI PDBeChem site</A>
(formerly MSDChem) maintains both PDB and MOL format coordinate files for all existing
PDB heterogens.  It has search tools to find
matching or similar compounds, which seems to work better than the Ligand Expo
search tool. (Note: HIC-UP includes links to matching PDBeChem entries, but PDBeChem
is updated more frequently.)</P>

<p><a href="http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/products/csd/"
target="csd">Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)</a>
is the most comprehensive resource for small molecules structures.  At the time
of this writing, the CSD contains crystal structure information for over
460,000 organic and metal organic compounds. The coordinates are in general of
high quality and very well suited for the derivation of topology and parameter
definitions. However, the CSD is a commercial product and therefore its use is
limited to members of registered, paying institutions.</P>

<p><B><U>Modelling coordinates from scratch</U></B></P>
<p>Some of the available parameterization tools support energy minimization
using advanced force-fields or quantum-mechanical optimization. In most cases,
the optimized coordinates are accurate enough to generate reasonable parameters.
However, the are also prone to errors.</P>
<!--
The next best resource for obtaining coordinates, or even ready-to-use
<tt>CNS</tt> topology and parameter files, are the <a
href="http://www.bio.net/" target="bionet">BIOSCI</a> news groups.  If
the compound is not too exotic, there is a fair chance that someone
responds to a request for hetero compound coordinates.

The <a href="http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org/ld-search.html" target="ligand_expo">PDB Ligand Expo search page</a>
includes MarvinSketch (press the [Launch] button). After sketching the molecule in 2D,
select <B>View -> Open in MarvinView3D</B>. It will generate 3D coordinates and display
them in a new window, from which you can save the coordinates in various formats,
including PDB and MOL format. The resulting 3D coordinates are only qualitatively accurate,
and must be optimized before generating parameters.
<p>
<a href="http://www.molecular-networks.com/online_demos/corina_demo"
target="corina">Corina</a> generates 3D coordinates from a SMILES structure
description, performs energy minimization, and returns the coordinates
in <tt>PDB</tt> format. You can create the SMILES string using the JME Molecular
Editor, available from many sites, or directly from
<a href="http://www.molinspiration.com/cgi-bin/properties" target="molinspiration">Molinspiration</a>.
Just sketch a molecule, then click the smiley-face button.

The problem with coordinates built from scratch and with energy
minimization is that the resulting conformation frequently is not the
one observed in the crystal structure. In case of doubt, the best
approach is to build the molecule based on the experimental electron
density, optionally followed by energy minimization.
