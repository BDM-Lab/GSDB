<P>The topology statement consists of information about "residues"
that combine to form a particular macromolecule. The data include
descriptions of atoms, assignments of covalent bonds (connectivity),
bond angles, and other information. The information provided by the
topology statement is used by the segment statement and the patch
statement to generate the molecular structure.</P>

<P>CNS, like many other macromolecular mechanics/dynamics packages,
can use a classification scheme that employs chemical atom types. This
system of atom classification makes force fields transferable between
groups that are almost equivalent and thereby allows one definition to
work for all or almost all instances of that type of atom. The
specific atom classifications can be arbitrarily defined by the user.
The parameters of chemical atom types are given in the parameter
statement. Electric charges are specified on an individual atom basis,
since they are less transferable than stereochemical parameters. For
historical reasons, atomic masses may also be specified on an
individual atom basis, but there exists the mass statement outside
the residue statement that assigns default atomic masses on a basis of
chemical atom type.  Apart from the type-based parameter retrieval,
CNS also provides atom-based parameter statements, which allow one to
specify any parameter on a per-atom basis.</P>

<P>The topology statement is invoked from the main level of CNS (the
topology information is most often read from a library file.</P>

</PRE>

<P>The CNS topology statements are as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>AUTOgenerate ANGLe=logical DIHEdral=logical END</B> works only
on regular residues, not on patch residues. It automatically generates
all possible bond angles based on the connectivity list of the
particular residue. It operates on the residues following the
statement until the next autogenerate statement appears.</LI>

<LI><B>MASS=type=real</B> adds a default mass assignment for the
specified type of atom to the topology database. The real number is
defined in atomic mass units. This value will be used by default for
all atoms of that type unless an explicit MASS statement is given in
the atom statement (see below).</LI>

<LI><B>RESEt</B> erases all previous entries into the topology
database.</LI>

<LI><B>RESIdue residue-name { residue-statements } END</B> adds a
residue to the topology database.</LI>

<LI><B>PRESidue residue-name { [ ADD | DELEte | MODIfy ]
residue-statement } END</B> adds a patch residue to the topology
database.</LI>

</UL>

<P>The allowed residue statements are as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>ANGLe atom atom atom</B> adds a bond angle made by the three
atoms to the residue database.  It should not be used if autogenerate
angles are active.</LI>

<LI><B>ATOM [patch-character] atom atom-statement END</B> adds an atom
to the residue database. The statement defines atom as a
four-character string specifying the name, and atom statement
specifies atom type, charge, and mass. The patch character is a
1-character string and may be used only for PRESidue.</LI>

<LI><B>BOND atom atom</B> adds a covalent bond between the specified
atoms to the residue database.  The atoms have to be defined
previously by atom statements.</LI>

<LI><B>DIHEdral atom atom atom atom [MULTiple integer]</B> adds a
dihedral angle to the residue database. The dihedral angle (ijkl) is
defined by the angle between the plane made by the atoms (ijk) and the
plane made by the atoms (jkl). The dihedral statement should not be
used if autogenerate dihedrals are active, unless multiple dihedral
angles are wanted. MULTiple specifies m dihedral angle entries for the
same instance of four atoms. This allows one to specify a cosine
expansion for the dihedral angle potential energy. It must be
accompanied by a corresponding DIHEdral angle parameter entry with
appropriate multiplicity.</LI>

<LI><B>GROUP</B> partitions the atoms into nonbonded groups.</LI>

<LI><B>IMPRoper atom atom atom atom [MULTiple integer]</B> adds an
improper angle to the residue database. The definition is identical to
the DIHEdral angle, but it uses a different set of parameters. As in
the case of the DIHEdral angle, the improper angle (ijkl) is defined
by the angle between the plane made by the atoms (ijk) and the plane
made by the atoms (jkl).  MULTiple specifies m improper angle entries
for the same instance of four atoms.  This allows one to specify a
cosine expansion for the improper angle potential energy. It must be
accompanied by a corresponding IMPRoper angle parameter entry with
appropriate multiplicity.</LI>

</UL>

<P>An atom is the defined by a character string (a maximum of 4
characters in length). The definition of an atom in a residue or patch
residue can include the following statements:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>CHARge=real</B> specifies an electrostatic charge in units of
one electron charge. This affects the electrostatic energy.</LI>

<LI><B>EXCLude=( { atom } )</B> specifies explicit nonbonded
interaction exclusions. The atoms have to have been defined previously
by an atom statement.</LI>

<LI><B>MASS=real</B> overwrites a default mass given by a mass
statement outside the residue statement, in atomic mass units.</LI>

<LI><B>TYPE=type</B> specifies the chemical atom type, a string with
up to four characters. The atom type is used to retrieve type-based
parameters.</LI>
