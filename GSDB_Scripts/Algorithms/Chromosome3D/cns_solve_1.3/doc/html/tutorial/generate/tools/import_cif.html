<h2>Importing CIF Monomer descriptions</h2>
<HR>
<P>The CIF Monomer format, developed by CCP4 REFMAC, is essentially a <I>de facto</I>
standard to define ligand and residue geometries. The format is supported by several
programs, and the quality of available CIF refinement parameters continues to improve.
The CIF Monomer format was published in
<A HREF="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?ba5073" target="_blank">Acta Cryst D</A> and is
<A HREF="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~alexei/dictionary.html" target="_blank">summarized here.</A>
It is based on the
<A HREF="http://deposit.rcsb.org/cc_dict_tut.html" target="_blank">PDB chemical component mmCIF format</A>,
but is currently not part of the formal PDB mmCIF standard.</P>

<P>The <B>cns_import_cif</B> utility program can read a CIF Monomer file
and write out CNS topology and parameter files. Run "<b><a
href="cns_import_cif.html" target="_blank">cns_import_cif --man</a></b>"
to read the built-in documentation.

<P>In order to avoid the atom CHEMical type name conflicts that occur with
parameters from tools such as XPLO2D, restraints are written using atom-based
parameters, as used by cis-peptide restraint modifications. The CHEMical name
is given the atomic element name, and is only used for scatter-factor and
non-bonded parameters. (See <a href="../parameter/text.html">Making parameter
files</a> for more information on atom-based parameters.)</P>

<P><B>NOTE:</B> Atom-based parameters only apply to atoms currently defined in the molecular topology. They do not apply to newly generated atoms after the atom-based parameter file has been generated. However, all standard CNS scripts read the parameters in the proper order, so they should
work with no errors.</P>

<h2>Example: Importing CIF Parameters for NADP</h2>

<h3>1) Obtain a CIF Monomer file</h3>
<p>PHENIX and REFMAC include CIF parameters for NADP in their standard
ligand libraries. The compound ID is NAP (same as the 3-letter code).
This tutorial will use the CIF file from PHENIX: "$PHENIX/chem_data/mon_lib/n/NAP.cif":</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt><a href="NAP.cif">NAP.cif</a></tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the REFMAC/CCP4 file ($CLIBD/monomers/n/NAP.cif) is identical to
  the PHENIX version. PHENIX started with the CCP4 library, but includes far
  fewer entries.  The CCP4 library is auto-generated, and has not been carefully
  validated. PHENIX has culled out entries that may have problems, with a rather
  strict selection criteria. Some of the excluded CCP4 entries are probably OK,
but beware that some of them have serious problems.</p>

<h3>2) Convert the CIF Monomer file to CNS topology and parameter files</h3>

<p>Run the CIF import utility using the command "<b>cns_import_cif --invoke-cns NAP.cif</b>".
This will create topology and parameter files using the default options, </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt><a href="NAP.top">NAP.top</a></tt></p>
  <p><tt><a href="NAP.par">NAP.par</a></tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and will automatically
  run cns on the validation input file which will produced minimized coordinates of the NAP compound:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt><a href="NAP_min.pdb">NAP_min.pdb</a></tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The output produced by <tt>cns_import_cif</tt> should look like this:</p>
<pre>
Processing CIF file: NAP.cif
Residue "NAP":
73 atom(s), 77 bond(s), 135 angle(s), 47 dihedral(s), 8 chiral centre(s), 3 planar group(s)
22 atoms in 3 plane group(s) produced 22 impropers (6 fixed).
8 secondary chiral restraints were added.
Writing topology file "NAP.top"
Writing parameter file "NAP.par"
Writing import log file "NAP.log"
Writing CNS validation input file "NAP.inp"
Running command: cns &lt; NAP.inp &gt;&amp; NAP_cns.log
</pre>

<p>The first line of statistics indicates the number of geometric terms read from the input file.
Planar groups are decomposed into improper torsions. In this case, there were 22 planarity
impropers, and the CIF parameters explicitly defined six of them with fixed angles. A proper
CIF Monomer defines enough fixed planar torsions to ensure the correct geometry within
each planar group.</p>

<p>There are also 8 secondary chiral restraints. CIF defines the stereochemistry of the chiral
center and three bonded atoms. For tetrahedral geometries, the secondary chiral restraint includes
the fourth bonded atom. This is required for CNS successfully auto-build missing atoms successfully.</p>

<p>Warnings are written as comments in the topology output file. In this case, no problems were found.
Here are a few lines from "NAP.top":</p>

</pre>
<p>The comments include the CIF label for torsions and plane groups. For chiral centers,
the "-extra" suffix is added for the secondary chiral restraints. For plane groups,
the explicitly defined torsions are included as comment lines.</p>


<h3>3) Validate the results</h3>

<P>Parameters should always be validated by energy minimization, the optimized
result checked for problems, and visualized to make sure the geometry is
sensible. It is also valuable to use more than one parameterization tool and
compare results.</P>

<P>The CNS validation script, which is automatically run with the --invoke-cns flag,
auto-builds any missing atoms, does energy minimization, and includes an overall
statistical summary at the end of the output log file:</P>
<pre>
Comp.ID     E0/atom     E/atom     E(VDW); RMS:Bonds     Angles      Impr.      Dihe.    Coor.;  Built
NAP           1.331      1.149      0.932      0.002      0.648      0.084     34.405    0.267   0/76
</pre>
<P><B>E0/atom</B> is the total energy per atom calculated by CNS for the input
coordinate file, and <B>E/atom</B> is the energy after minimization. The final
energy should ideally be about 1 or less, with slightly higher values for large
molecules. An energy of 4 or more usually indicates a problem. Ideally, the input
reference coordinates should also have a low energy when available, but many
CIF files include non-ideal coordinates.</P> 

<P>RMSD statistics are shown for geometry restraints. Theses are normally lower than
refinement against X-ray data. If reference coordinates were defined, the coordinate
RMSD should be near zero for rigid molecules, but is not always meaningful for
flexible molecules.  <B>E(VDW)</B> is the total Van der Waals energy,
and should be less than one. Large values are usually an indication of serious
geometry or parameter errors.</P>

<P><B>Built 0/76</B> means that zero of 76 atoms were added using a
variation of the CNS auto-build protocol. Many CIF Monomer files do not include
reference coordinates. The auto-build protocol typically is able to generate
an entire molecule, but errors can occur, especially for very large molecules.
You may be able to obtain ideal coordinates from
<A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/chempdb" target="ebi">EBI PDBeChem</A> or
<A href="http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org/" target="rcsb">RCSB Ligand Expo</A>
and re-run the validation script using the idealized starting coordinates.</P>

<P>In this example, the statistics look good, so the next step is to visualize
the result. This example uses PDB v.2 nomenclature, which has 'N' or 'A'
prefixes for the nicotinamide and adeinine components.  This is likely to cause
element misidentification, because CNS does not yet write the element name at
the end of PDB ATOM records.</P>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="NADP1.png" width="438" height="256"
alt="Edge view of the nicotinamide ring in NADP"
style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 4px; align: center;"><br>
<b>The nicotinamide ring in NADP energy-minimized with CNS</b></div>

<p>Careful inspection shows that the amide group NC7 is out of the plane from the
nicotinamide ring, causing the NC3 atom to be non-planar. The NC3-NC7 bond deviates 23
degrees from the plane. Atom NC7 should have been included with the plane containing
the ring, but checking the CIF file indicates that it was not:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <tt>NAP      plan-2    NN1       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC1*      0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC2       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC6       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC3       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC4       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC5       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-3    NC7       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-3    NC3       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-3    NO7       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-3    NN7       0.020</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fix is to merge the two plane definitions: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <tt>NAP      plan-2    NN1       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC1*      0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC2       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC6       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC3       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC4       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC5       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC7       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NC3       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NO7       0.020<br>
    NAP      plan-2    NN7       0.020</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and to re-run <tt>cns_import_cif </tt>with the fixed CIF file. </P>
<p>Another potential problem visible in this view is that hydrogens NH2 and NH72 are
  quite close. The partial double-bond character of NC3-NC7 favors the amide group being
  planar with the ring, but the NH2-NH72 VdW interaction disfavors planarity. The result
  is a torsion offset from the plane. The CIF parameters define the torsion NC2-NC3-NC7-NO7
  with an angle of 168.83 with a periodicity of one. (This becomes -11.17 in CNS due to
  different periodic restraint equations.) This value is reasonable for basing parameters
  on a single energy-minimized reference molecule, but does not account for the offset being
  positive. In addition, the amide group can flip, and the periodicity should be two. One
  solution is to use a low energy constant (corresponding to a large CIF ESD), and let the
  refinement determine the correct torsion. At lower resolution, you may want to modify
  the torsion parameters to restrain towards one of the ideal +/-11.17 offsets once the
  approximate torsion is determined. This is essentially the approach taken for nucleic-acid
  sugar puckers.</P>

<P>The important lesson is that even the best parameterization tools are imperfect.
Parameters should always be considered with a bit of skepticism, and carefully
validated.</P>
