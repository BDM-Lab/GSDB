<H2>Generating and manipulating the molecular topology</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>The segment statement generates the molecular structure by
interpreting the coordinate file to obtain the residue sequence or by
explicitly specifying the residue sequence. The residues have to be
defined in the topology statement. Appropriate patches to are applied
to generate covalent links between or within molecules, such as
disulfide bridges.</P>

<U>Syntax</U>

<P>The segment statement is used to generate the molecular topology
information. This is invoked from the main level of CNS:</P>

<PRE>
  SEGMent { segment-statement } END
</PRE>

<P>The possible segment statements are as follows:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>CHAIn { [chain-statement] } END</B> generates a sequence of
residues. The END statement activates the generation.</LI>

<LI><B>MOLEcule NAME=residue-name NUMBer=integer END</B> generates
individual molecules such as in liquids (default for NUMBer is 1). The
residue numbers are assigned sequentially, starting with 1. The
residue name has to be defined in the topology statement. The END
statement activates the generation of the molecules.</LI>

<LI><B>NAME=segment-name</B> specifies the segment name of all atoms
to be generated using the following statements (default is " ").</LI>

</UL>

<P>The chain statement is most often used to generate molecular
topology from the sequence read from a coordinate file. The possible
chain statements are as follows:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>COORdinates { pdb-record } END</B> takes a sequence from a
coordinate file. It interprets the atom records of a PDB coordinate
file in terms of the sequence of the molecule. The residue numbers are
taken directly from the PDB coordinate file; they do not have to be
sequential. Note that this statement does not actually read the x,y,z
coordinates. One should use the coordinate statement to read the
coordinates. The segment name has to match characters 73 through 76 in
the PDB coordinate file if the segment name has been explicitly
defined with the NAME statement.</LI>

<LI><B>SEPArate-by-segid=logical</B> If true, linkages will not be
applied between different segment names. A new covalent chain will be
started when a new segid is encountered.</LI>

<LI><B>CONVert-chainid-to-segid=logical</B> If true, the segid will be
read from the PDB chain field (column 22) provided that the chain
identifier is non-blank. If used in molecular topology generation the
same keyword must also when reading the coordinates from the main level
of CNS.</LI>

<LI><B>FIRSt residue-name TAIL=patch-character=*residue-name* END</B>
adds a special patch for the first residue in a sequence to the chain
database. In the case of multiple statements, equality has priority
before wildcard matching; i.e., the more special assignments come
first. The chain database is reset each time the chain statement is
invoked.</LI>

<LI><B>LAST residue-name HEAD=patch-character=*residue-name* END</B>
adds a special patch for the last residue in a sequence to the chain
database. In the case of multiple statements, equality has priority
before wildcard matching; i.e., the more special assignments come
first. The chain database is reset each time the chain statement is
invoked.</LI>

<LI><B>LINK residue-name HEAD=patch-character=*residue-name*
TAIL=patch-character=*residue-name* END</B> adds a special linkage
patch to the chain database. The statement will automatically connect
residue i to residue i+1; for example, it creates a peptide linkage.
Wildcards are allowed for residue name. In the case of multiple
statements, equality has priority before wildcard matching; i.e., the
more special assignments come first. The chain database is reset each
time the chain statement is invoked.</LI>

<LI><B>SEQUence { residue-name } END</B> takes the sequence as
specified between the SEQUence and the END word. The residue numbers
are assigned sequentially, starting with 1.</LI>

</UL>

<U>Requirements</U>

<P>The molecular topology has to be defined. Execution of the segment
statement destroys fragile atom selections.</P>

<U>Example: A Polypeptide Chain</U>

<P>The following example file shows how to set up a polypeptide
segment (Tyr, Ala, Glu, Lys, Ile, Ala), assuming that the topology and
parameters have been previously read. For completeness, the
definitions of the patch residues PEPT, PROP, NTER, and CTER have been
included. Normally, these patch residues are already defined in the
topology files.</P>

<P>Here is an example generating the molecular topology from a
coordinate file using the chain identifier to generate the segid and
recognizing each chain as a separate molecule:</P>

<PRE>

end

</PRE>

<P>The information about the patch residues is normally included in
the topology file. The information about the peptide linkages is also
included in the "protein.link" file in the "libraries/toppar"
directory. Wildcards allow one to use the same patch residues ("PEPT")
for all combinations of amino acids. The only exception is Pro, which
needs a special patch. The residues are numbered consecutively,
starting with 1. To use a particular numbering for residues, one
should use the COOR option to read the sequence from the coordinate
file.</P>

<U>Patching the Molecular Structure</U>

<P>The patch statement refers to a patch residue (PRESidue), which
consists of additions of atoms by the add statement, modifications by
the modify statement, or deletions by the delete statement. A patch
can establish chain linkages, such as peptide bonds, chain termini,
disulfide bridges, and covalent links to ligands.</P>

<U>Syntax</U>

<P>The patch statement is invoked from the main level of CNS:</P>

<PRE>
  PATCh patch-residue
    REFErence=NIL|patch-character=(atom-selection)
    ....
  END
</PRE>

<P>Patches the specified selections of atoms using the patch residue
with name residue name. The patch character corresponds to the first
character in the PRES specification. The specification of NIL implies
that in the PRESidue the patch characters are omitted. Multiple
references are used to establish links to more than one residue.</P>

<U>Requirements</U>

<P>The molecular structure has to be well defined. Execution of the
patch statement destroys fragile atom selections; e.g., the atom
properties are conserved during patching, except for the internal
stores (STORE1, STORE2, ... ). The atom properties of additional atoms
are set to default values. Other information, such as information for
the xray or noe statements, is lost during patching.</P>

<U>Example: Incorporation of Disulfide Bridges</U>

<P>The DISU patch residue defines the covalent link between two
cysteine residues. To make a disulfide bridge, the following patch
statement can be used:</P>

<PRE>
topology 
   presidue DISU     
      group 
      modify atom 1CB           charge= 0.19  END 
      modify atom 1SG  type=S   charge=-0.19  END 
      group 
      modify atom 2CB           charge= 0.19  END 
      modify atom 2SG  type=S   charge=-0.19  END 

      add bond 1SG 2SG 

      add angle  1CB 1SG 2SG 
      add angle  1SG 2SG 2CB 

      add dihedral   1CA 1CB 1SG 2SG 
      add dihedral   1CB 1SG 2SG 2CB 
      add dihedral   1SG 2SG 2CB 2CA 

   end 
end 

patch disu
   reference=1=( resid 15 ) reference=2=( resid 25 ) 
end 
</PRE>

<P>This will make a disulfide bridge between residue number 15 and
residue number 25. (For completeness, the definition of the patch
residue DISU is listed here as well. Normally, this patch residue is
already included in the topology files.)</P>

<U>Example: Modification of the Protonation Degree of Histidines</U>

<P>The protonation degree of HIS can be changed by using the patch
residues HISE and HISD that are defined in file "protein.top", which
is located in the "libraries/toppar" directory. The histidine patches
can be invoked by using the patch statement:</P>

<PRE>
patch HISE 
   reference=nil=( resid 14 ) 
end 
</PRE>

<P>This changes the protonation degree of His-14 to that of a singly
HE2-protonated histidine.</P>

<U>Deleting Atoms</U>

<P>The delete statement removes the selected atoms from the current
molecular structure. It will also delete any connections such as
bonds, bond angles, or dihedral angles involving an atom that is
deleted.</P>

<U>Syntax</U>

<PRE>
  DELEte 
    SELEction=(atom-selection)
  END
</PRE>

<U>Requirements</U>

<P>The molecular structure has to be well defined. Execution of the
delete statement destroys fragile atom selections; e.g., the atom
properties are conserved during deletions, except for the internal
stores (STORE1, STORE2, ... ). Other information, such as information
for the xray or noe statements, is lost during deletions.</P>

<U>Example: Delete One Atom</U>

<P>To remove the hydrogen of peptide nitrogen of residue 1, one can
specify:</P>

<PRE>
  delete 
    selection=(resid 1 and name HN) 
 end
</PRE>

<U>Duplicating the Molecular Structure</U>

<P>The duplicate statement allows one to duplicate the molecular
structure or selected atoms of it. The statement duplicates all atom
properties, coordinates, connectivities, bonds, angles, etc. It has a
renaming feature that allows one to specify a new segment or residue
name for the duplicated atoms.</P>

<U>Syntax</U>

<P>The duplicate statement is invoked from the main level of CNS:</P>

<PRE>
  DUPLicate { duplicate-statement } END
</PRE>

<P>The possible duplicate statements are as follows:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>RESIdue=residue-name</B> specifies the residue name of the
duplicated atoms (default: same as original atoms).</LI>

<LI><B>SEGId=segid-name</B> specifies the segment name of the
duplicated atoms (default: same as original atoms).</LI>

<LI><B>SELEction=atom-selection</B> selects the atoms that are to be
duplicated.</LI>

</UL>

<U>Requirements</U>

<P>The molecular structure has to be well defined. Execution of the
duplicate statement destroys fragile atom selections.</P>

<U>Example: Duplication of Side-Chain Atoms</U>

<P>The following example duplicates the atoms of a side chain. The
duplicated atoms are identical to the original ones except for the
segment name.</P>

<PRE>
duplicate 
   selection=( resid 40 and not 
             ( name ca or name n or name c or name o ) ) 
   segid="NEW" 
end 
</PRE>

<U>Structure Statement</U>

<P>The structure statement allows one to read a molecular structure
file that has been written previously by the write structure
statement.</P>

<U>Syntax</U>

<P>The structure statement is invoked from the main level of CNS:</P>

<PRE>
  STRUcture { structure-statement } END
</PRE>

<P>The possible structure statements are as follows:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>mtf-records</B> adds mtf-records to the molecular structure
database. The mtf-records contain fixed-field records written by the
write structure statement. They are not stored in the rotating
statement buffer during loop execution.</LI>

<LI><B>RESEt</B> eliminates the current molecular structure in
CNS.</LI>

</UL>

<U>Requirements</U>

<P>Execution of the duplicate statement destroys fragile atom
selections.</P>

<U>Example: How to Read a Molecular Structure File</U>

<P>The following example shows how to read the molecular structure
file "molecule1.mtf":</P>

<PRE>
structure 
   @molecule1.mtf 
end 
</PRE>

<U>Example: Append Two Molecular Structure Files</U>

<P>Molecular structure information can be appended:</P>

<PRE>
structure 
   @molecule1.mtf 
   @molecule2.mtf 
end 
</PRE>

<P>but care should be taken to avoid duplicate atom definitions.</P>

<U>Writing a Molecular Topology File</U>

<P>The write structure statement writes the current molecular topology
to the specified output file. The molecular topology file (MTF file)
contains information that was generated by the segment statement and
modified by the patch statement or the delete statement. Specifically,
the molecular topology file contains the following information: atom
names, types, charges, and masses; residue names and segment names;
and a list of bond terms, angle terms, dihedral terms, improper terms,
explicit nonbonded exclusions, and nonbonded group partitions. It does
not contain atomic coordinates, parameters, constraints, restraints,
or any other information that is specific to effective energy terms,
such as diffraction data. The molecular topology file is in STAR
format (like the mmCIF format).</P>
