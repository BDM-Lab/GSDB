<P>The parameter statement specifies various constants for the
conformational and nonbonded energy terms and for a number of other
CNS applications, such as distance geometry.</P>

<P>CNS stores and manipulates the parameter information in two forms:
"type-based" and "atom-based". A type-based parameter is characterized
by the chemical types of the atoms involved; an atom-based parameter
is characterized by the individual atoms involved. The chemical types
of the atoms are specified in the topology statement and can be
manipulated with the do statement. The chemical types usually map
chemically equivalent atoms to the same type; e.g., all carbonyl
oxygen atoms are mapped to the type "O". This implies that there are
usually many more atoms in the molecular structure than there are atom
types. The use of atom types can thus reduce the number of parameters
that need to be specified for a molecular structure. However, this
convenience could pose a problem when the chemical environment of a
particular atom induces distortions of the expected "ideal" geometry
for the corresponding atom type. It would not necessarily be a good
idea to introduce a new atom type, as the number of atom types is
limited. To get around this problem, CNS supports atom-based parameter
information. This implies that, at least in principle, one could have
a different parameter for each interaction between particular
atoms. Atom-based parameters are possible for bonds, bond angles,
dihedral angles, improper angles, and van der Waals interactions.</P>

<P>CNS allows one to mix atom-based and type-based
parameters. Atom-based parameters always take precedence over
type-based parameters. The atom-based parameter information can be
obtained through appropriate explicit parameter statements, such
as:</P>

<PRE>
  bond ( name c* ) ( name n* ) 500. TOKEN 
</PRE>

<P>or through the Cartesian coordinates in the main coordinate set in
combination with the learn statement. This atom-based information is
augmented with the type-based information each time an CNS application
requests it; e.g., the call to an energy routine triggers an operation
that retrieves all parameters not set by atom-based information from
the type-based parameter database. In this way either atom-based
parameters, type-based parameters, or a combination of both can be
used. Atom-based parameters can be changed or added at any time during
program execution. Type-based parameters cannot be manipulated, but
additional entries can be added or the database erased and
reinitialized. The mapping of atoms to chemical types can be
manipulated by applying the vector statement to the chemical atom
property. All these changes will take effect the next time the
particular parameter is requested by an CNS application.</P>

<P>The parameter specifications are insensitive to the order in which
the atoms are specified:</P>

<PRE>
  bond a b 10.0 1.0 
</PRE>

<P>and</P>

<PRE>
  bond b a 10.0 1.0 
</PRE>

<P>are seen as identical parameter entries by CNS.</P>

<P>The constants of the parameter statement are dimensioned such that
A is the unit of length, kcal mole-1 is the unit of energy, the atomic
mass unit is the unit of mass, and the charge of one electron is the
unit of electric charge.</P>

<P>Obtaining empirical parameters for macromolecules is a difficult
task. To describe the development of parameters is beyond the scope of
this text (see other sections for sources of information). CNS
includes a number of parameter files for proteins, nucleic acids, and
other biological macromolecules (see other sections for further
details). Fortunately, structure determination and refinement of
crystallographic or NMR-derived structures are usually not very
sensitive to the exact choice of energy constants.</P>

<P>The parameter statement is invoked from the main level of CNS (the
parameter information is most often read from a library file).</P>

</PRE>

<P>The CNS parameter statements are as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>ANGLe type type type real real [UB real real]</B> adds a bond
angle parameter set for the three atom types to the parameter
database. The first real specifies the force constant, which has units
of kcal mole-1 rad-2, and the second real specifies the equilibrium
angle, which has units of degrees. The optional UB specification
activates the Urey-Bradley term, where the first real is the
Urey-Bradley energy constant and the second real is the Urey-Bradley
equilibrium distance between the first and the third atom that define
the angle. If UB is not specified, the Urey-Bradley equilibrium
distance and energy constant default to zero. The program
automatically performs an interchange of the first with the third atom
types where this is required.</LI>

<LI><B>ANGLe atom-selection atom-selection atom-selection real real
[UB real real]</B> is an atom-based version of the ANGLe statement
that specifies the bond angle parameters to be used for any angles in
the molecular structure that match the given triple atom selection. It
can apply to more than one angle, depending on the number of angles
that match the triple atom selection.  The definition of the reals is
identical to the type-based angle statement. The energy and
equilibrium constants can be set to the string TOKEn, which implies
that the corresponding parameter will be untouched by this
statement.</LI>

<LI><B>BOND type type real real</B> adds a covalent bond parameter set
for the two atom types to the parameter database. The first real
specifies the energy constant in units of kcal mole-1 &Aring;-2, and the
second real specifies the equilibrium bond length in &Aring;.  The program
automatically performs an interchange of the two atom types where this
is required.</LI>

<LI><B>BOND atom-selection atom-selection real real</B> is an
atom-based version of the BOND statement.  The definition of the reals
is identical to the type-based bond statement. It can apply to more
than one bond, depending on the number of bonds that match the double
atom selection. The energy and equilibrium constants can be set to the
string TOKEn, which implies that the corresponding parameter will be
untouched by this statement.</LI>

<LI><B>DIHEdral type type type type [MULT integer] { real integer real
}</B> adds a dihedral angle parameter set for the four atom types to
the parameter database. The MULT option specifies the multiplicity m
of the dihedral angle (default: m=1). For multiple dihedrals of
multiplicity m, there are m groups of 3 items following the MULT
integer statement. The first real of each group specifies the force
constant for this term, the integer is the periodicity n, and the
second real specifies the phase-shift angle, which has units of
degrees. If the periodicity n is greater than 0, the force constant
has the units of kcal mole-1; if the periodicity is 0, the force
constant has the units of kcal mol-1 rad-2. The special character X is
reserved for the following combination: X type type X; it acts as a
wildcard. The parameter retrieval for a specified dihedral angle
proceeds in the following way: first, a match without wildcards is
attempted, and second, a match against dihedral parameters containing
wildcards is attempted. Some instances (such as sugars) require the
mixing of multiple dihedral angle terms with different
periodicities. In this case, dihedral statements with the multiple
option should be given in the parameter statement and in the topology
statement. Wildcards are not allowed for multiple dihedral angles. The
program automatically performs the interchange (a b c d) to (d c b a)
where this is required.</LI>

<LI><B>DIHEdral atom-selection atom-selection atom-selection
atom-selection [MULT integer] { real integer real }</B> is an
atom-based version of the DIHEdral statement. The definition of the
real and integer numbers is identical to the DIHEdral definition. For
multiple dihedrals of multiplicity m, there are 3m items following the
MULT integer statement (i.e., m sets of one energy constant, one
periodicity, and one offset). The statement can apply to more than one
dihedral angle, depending on the number of bonds that match the
quadruple atom selection.  An atom-based statement takes priority over
any type-based parameter that may have been specified earlier. The
energy constants, periodicities, and offsets can be set to the string
TOKEn, which implies that the corresponding constant will be untouched
by this statement.</LI>

<LI><B>IMPRoper type type type type [MULT integer] { real integer real
}</B> adds an improper angle parameter set for the four atom types to
the parameter database. The definition is identical to the DIHEdral
definition, except for wildcards. The wildcard cascading for improper
angles is as follows: (a b c d) &gt; (a X X d) &gt; (X b c d) &gt; (X
b c X) &gt; (X X c d). The program automatically performs the
interchange (a b c d) to (d c b a) where this is required.</LI>

<LI><B>IMPRoper atom-selection atom-selection atom-selection
atom-selection [MULT integer] { real integer real }</B> is an
atom-based version of the IMPRoper statement. The definition of the
real and integer numbers is identical to the DIHEdral definition. The
statement can apply to more than one improper angle, depending on the
number of bonds that match the quadruple atom selection. The energy
constants, periodicities, and offsets can be set to the string TOKEn,
which implies that the corresponding constant will be untouched by
this statement.</LI>

<LI><B>LEARn { learn-statements } END</B> learns atom-based parameters
from one or more sets of Cartesian coordinates.</LI>

<LI><B>NBFIx type type real real real real</B> adds a Lennard-Jones
parameter set for the specified pair of atom types to the parameter
database. The first two real numbers are the A, B coefficients for all
nonbonded interactions except the special 1-4 interactions; the second
pair of reals is for the 1-4 (NBXMod=+/-5) nonbonded
interactions. Appropriate NONB statements have to be specified for
both atom types before invoking this statement. The NBFIx statement
allows one to deviate from the standard combination rule for the
Lennard-Jones potential.</LI>

<LI><B>NBFIx atom-selection atom-selection real real real real</B> is
an atom-based version of the NBFIx statement that adds a Lennard-Jones
parameter set for the selected pairs of atoms to the atom-based
parameters. The definition of the reals is identical to the type-based
NBFIx statement. Appropriate atom-based NONB statements have to be
specified for both atom selections before invoking this statement:
<PRE>

<LI><B>NBONds { nbonds-statement } END</B> applies to both
electrostatic and van der Waals energy calculations. It sets up global
parameters for the nonbonded interaction list generation and
determines the form of subsequent nonbonded energy calculations.</LI>

<LI><B>NONB type real real real real</B> adds a Lennard-Jones
parameter set for pairs of atoms of the same specified type to the
parameter database. The first pair of reals is epsilon and sigma for
all nonbonded interactions except the special 1-4 interactions; the
second pair is epsilon and sigma for the 1-4 nonbonded interactions
(NBXMod=+/-5).</LI>

<LI><B>NONB atom-selection real real real real</B> is an atom-based
version of the NONB statement that adds a Lennard-Jones parameter set
for the selected atoms to the atom-based parameters.  The definition

the TOKEn keyword is not allowed for the reals.</LI>

parameters from existing atom-based parameters (see other sections).</LI>

<LI><B>RESEt [ ALL | TYPE | ATOM ]</B> erases all information about

erases both databases, TYPE erases just the type base, and ATOM erases

<P>The nonbonded statements for setting up the nonbonded energy
calculations are as follows:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>CDIE|RDIE</B> specifies exclusive flags: constant dielectric
(Coulomb's law) or 1/r-dependent dielectric. RDIE may only be used in
combination with VSWItch, SWITch, and REPEl=0. CDIE may be used in
combination with VSWItch, SHIFt, and REPEl=0 or in combination with
TRUNcation and REPEl=0 (default: CDIE).</LI>

<LI><B>CTOFNB=real</B> specifies the distance roff at which the
switching function or shifting function forces the nonbonded energy to
zero (default: 7.5&Aring;).</LI>

<LI><B>CTONNB=real</B> specifies the distance ron at which the
switching function becomes effective (default: 6.5&Aring;).</LI>

<LI><B>CUTNb=real</B> specifies the nonbonded interaction cutoff rcut
for the nonbonded list generation (default: 8.5&Aring;).</LI>

<LI><B>E14Fac=real</B> specifies the scale factor e14 for the special
1-4 electrostatic interactions (default: 1.0).</LI>

<LI><B>EPS=real</B> specifies the dielectric constant e (default:
1.0).</LI>

<LI><B>GROUp | ATOM</B> specifies exclusive flags: group by group or
atom by atom cutoff for nonbonded list generation (default: ATOM).</LI>

<LI><B>INHIbit=real</B> specifies the distance dinhibit between two
atoms below which the van der Waals potential is truncated (default:
0.25&Aring;).</LI>

<LI><B>IREXponent=integer</B> specifies the exponent irexp for the
repel function (default: 2).</LI>

<LI><B>NBXMod=+1|-1|+2|-2|+3|-3|+4|-4|+5|-5</B>	Exclusion list options:
<UL>

interactions are computed regardless of covalent bonds.</LI>
<LI><B>+-2</B> excludes nonbonded interactions between bonded

<LI><B>+-3</B> excludes nonbonded interactions between bonded atoms
and atoms that are bonded to a common third atom.</LI>

connected to each other through three bonds.</LI>
<LI><B>+-5</B> same as (+-3), but the 1-4 nonbonded interactions are
computed using the 1-4 Lennard-Jones parameters and the electrostatic
scale factor e14.</LI>
</UL>
A positive mode value causes explicit nonbonded exclusions to be taken
into account; a negative value causes them to be discarded (default:
5).</LI>

<LI><B>RCONst=real</B> specifies the energy constant Crep for the
repel function (default: 100.0).</LI>

<LI><B>REPEl=real</B> specifies krep: if > 0, this option turns on the
repel function and turns off the electrostatic energy. krep specifies
the factor by which to multiply the van der Waals radius Rmin
(default: 0).</LI>

<LI><B>REXPonent=integer</B> specifies the exponent rexp for the repel
function (default: 2).</LI>

<LI><B>SWItch|SHIFt</B> specifies exclusive flags: electrostatic
switching or shifting. SWITch may only be used in combination with
RDIE, VSWItch, and REPEl=0. SHIFt may only be used in combination with
CDIE, VSWItch, and REPEl=0 (default: SHIFt).</LI>

<LI><B>TOLErance=real</B> specifies the distance that any atom is
allowed to move before the nonbonded list gets updated. Note: if
switching or shifting functions are used, the program expects CUTNB >=
CTOFNB + 2*TOLErance. In this way the nonbonded energy is independent
of the update frequency. For the REPEl option, CUTNB and TOLErance
should be chosen such that CUTNB >= rmax + 2*TOLErance, where rmax is
the maximum van der Waals radius. TOLErance has no influence on the
TRUNcation option. (default: 0.5&Aring;).</LI>

<LI><B>TRUNcation</B> turns off switching or shifting; i.e., the
nonbonded energy functions are "truncated" at CUTNb regardless of the
values of CTONNB and CTOFNB. All nonbonded energy terms that are
included in the current nonbonded list are computed. May only be used
in combination with CDIE. Note: in general, the nonbonded energy will
not be conserved before and after nonbonded list updates when using
TRUNcation. (default: inactive).</LI>

<LI><B>VSWItch</B> turns on van der Waals switching. May only be used
in combination with RDIE, SWITch, and REPEl=0 or in combination with
CDIE, SHIFt, and REPEl=0 (default: active).</LI>

<LI><B>WMIN=real</B> specifies the threshold distance for close
contact warnings, i.e., a warning is issued when a pair of atoms gets
closer than this distance unless the nonbonded interaction is excluded
by the NBXMod option (default: 1.5&Aring;).</LI>

<P>The atom selections of atom-based parameter statements are
partially fragile; i.e, they are mapped when the molecular structure
is modified, but newly created atoms do not have atom-based parameters

<U>Examples of Atom-based Modifications of the Parameters</U>

addition to increasing the energy constant, the periodicity is set to

</PRE>

<U>Reducing to Type-based Parameters</U>

<P>The reduce statement allows one to reduce the current parameters
(atom-based as well as type-based) to type-based parameters using the
CHEMical atom properties. Each type-based equilibrium constant is
obtained as an average of all instances of that type of interaction
(bond, bond angle, dihedral angle, or improper angle) in the molecular
structure. The energy constants can be obtained as a simple average or
from the same statistical analysis as that used for the learn
statement. The latter option is useful only when several instances of
the same type-based interaction occur in the molecular structure. If
there is only one instance or the variance is zero, the "reduced"
energy constant is set to 999999. The periodicities (n) of dihedral
and improper angles have to be consistent for all instances of
atom-based parameters; otherwise a warning message will occur. The
"reduced" periodicities are taken directly from the atom-based
parameters. The reduce statement affects parameters only for those
interaction terms that are turned on by the flags statement.</P>

<U>Syntax</U>

<P>The reduce statements possible are:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>SELEction=atom-selection</B> reduces parameters for specified
atoms. All atoms of a particular interaction term (bond, bond angle,
etc.) have to be selected in order for the parameters for that term to
be learned (default: (ALL)).</LI>

<LI><B>OVERwrite=TRUE | FALSE</B> will overwrite the existing REDUce
statement type-based parameters if TRUE. If FALSE, the REDUce
statement will add only new type-based parameters; it will not
overwrite existing ones (default: FALSE).</LI>

<LI><B>MODE=AVERage | STATistical</B> obtains energy constants from a
simple average (AVERage) or from the statistical analysis
(STATistical). The latter option is useful only when several instances
of the same type-based interaction occur in the molecular
structure. For single instances or zero variance, the energy constant
will be set to 999999 (default: STATistics).</LI>

</UL>

<U>Example: Reducing Parameters Learned Previously</U>

<P>Suppose one has learned atom-based parameters for a ligand with
segment identifier LIGA from Cartesian coordinates. These atom-based
parameters are reduced to type-based parameters and then written to a
file:</P>

<PRE>
  parameters reduce sele=(segid LIGA ) mode=average end end 
  write parameters output=protein_new.param end
</PRE>

<P>For each bonded pair of chemical types, an equilibrium geometry is
obtained by averaging the atom-based parameters of all the bonds in
the molecular structure that match this chemical type pair. For
example, in a protein, this could imply averaging over all C-C bonds
in aromatic rings, or all C-O carbonyl bonds. The same averaging is
done for bond angles, dihedrals and impropers, equilibrium geometries,
and energy constants. Dihedral and improper periodicities will
correspond to their atom-based values. The new parameter file can be
read by CNS in subsequent runs.</P>
