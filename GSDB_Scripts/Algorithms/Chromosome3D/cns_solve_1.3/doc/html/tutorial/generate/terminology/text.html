<P>CNS reads the coordinate (PDB) file twice:</P>

<PRE>

 segment
   chain
     @@CNS_TOPPAR:protein.link
     coordinates @@file.pdb     <--- first read
   end
 end

 coordinates @@file.pdb    <--- second read

</PRE>

<P>In the first pass, only the residue names are read, from which it
generates an internal list of the atoms which should be present and
how they are connected (by using the topology files in the
library/toppar directory). After this internal molecular topology has
been constructed the coordinates are read a second time. At this point
the coordinate records must match the internal topology for the
coordinates to be read in. If there are inconsistencies in the atom
naming but not the residue naming in a coordinate file then the first
pass will succeed (as the residue names are correct). However, the
second stage where the coordinates themselves are read will fail for
some atoms. The following message will be obtained for those
atoms:</P>

<PRE>
 %READC-ERR: atom 1HOE 74   LEU  OT   not found in molecular structure
</PRE>

<P>If there are some atoms that are not present in the input
coordinate file or are incorrectly named (compared to the CNS topology
library) then there will be coordinates missing for some atoms. This
will be reported after the coordinates have been read for the second
time:</P>

<PRE>
 %READC-WRN: still    170 missing coordinates (in selected subset)
</PRE>

<P>Coordinates (X,Y,Z) for these atoms must either be generated or the
atoms deleted. For crystallographic applications in general the
missing atoms are hydrogens which are deleted prior to writing out the
final molecular topology information.</P>
