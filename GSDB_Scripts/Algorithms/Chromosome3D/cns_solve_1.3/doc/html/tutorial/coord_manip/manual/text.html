<H2>Manual coordinate manipulation</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>The coordinate statement is used to read and manipulate
coordinates, such as least-squares fitting to a comparison coordinate
set, rotation, translation, and conversion between fractional and
orthogonal coordinates.</P>

<U>Syntax</U>

<P>The coordinate statement options are carried out when the END
statement is issued. If one wants to carry out several coordinate
manipulations, each manipulation has to be initiated separately from
the main level of CNS.</P>

<P><B>COORdinates coordinate-statement END</B> is invoked from the
main level of CNS. The END statement activates execution of the
particular operation.</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>COPY [SELEction=atom-selection]</B> copies main coordinate set
into comparison set; XCOMP:=X,YCOMP:=Y,ZCOMP:=Z; B,Q are unaffected
(default for selection: (ALL) ).</LI>

<LI><B>FIT [SELEction=atom-selection] [MASS=logical] [LSQ=logical]</B>
rotates (if LSQ is TRUE) and translates all main coordinates to obtain
a best fit between the selected main and comparison atoms. Translation
superimposes the geometric centers (or the centers of mass if MASS is
TRUE) of the two coordinate sets. Rotation occurs with the Kabsch
(1976) least-squares fitting algorithm. Mass-weighting is applied if
MASS is set to TRUE. Upon successful completion of this operation, the
Eulerian angles describing the rotation matrix R are stored in the
symbols $THETA1, $THETA2, $THETA3, and the translation vector T is
stored in the symbols $X, $Y, $Z. The fitted coordinate set r' is
related to original set r by r'=R*r + T (default for selection: (ALL);
for MASS: FALSE; for LSQ: TRUE).</LI>

<LI><B>FRACtionalize [SELEction=atom-selection]</B> fractionalizes
selected coordinates. The CNS convention keeps the direction of the
x-axis (x same direction as a; y is in (a,b) plane) and is the same
that is used internally by all CNS routines (default for selected
atoms: (ALL)). The unit cell geometry needs to be specified before
invoking this statement.</LI>

<LI><B>INITialize [SELEction=atom-selection]</B> initializes main
coordinate set; i.e., X:=9999.0, Y:=9999.0, Z:=9999.0; B,Q are
unaffected (default for selection: (ALL) ).</LI>

<LI><B>ORIEnt [SELEction=atom-selection] [MASS=logical]
[LSQ=logical]</B> rotates (if LSQ is TRUE) and translates all
coordinates such that the principal axis system of the selected atoms
corresponds to the x,y,z axis. The translation superimposes the
geometric center (or the center of mass if MASS is TRUE) and the
coordinate origin. The rotation occurs with the Kabsch (1976)
least-squares fitting algorithm. Mass-weighting is applied if MASS is
set to TRUE.  Upon successful completion of this operation, the
Eulerian angles describing the rotation matrix R are stored in the
symbols $THETA1, $THETA2, $THETA3, and the translation vector T is
stored in the symbols $X, $Y, $Z. The oriented coordinate set r' is
related to original set r by r'=R*r + T (default for selection: (ALL);
for MASS: FALSE; for LSQ: TRUE).</LI>

<LI><B>ORTHogonalize [SELEction=atom-selection]</B> orthogonalizes
selected coordinates. The CNS convention keeps the direction of the
x-axis (x same direction as a; y is in (a,b) plane) and is the same
that is used internally by all CNS routines (default for selected
atoms: (ALL)). The unit cell geometry needs to be specified before
invoking this statement.</B>

<LI><B>RGYRation [SELEction=atom-selection] [MASS=logical]
[FACT=real]</B> computes radius of gyration
(Rgyr=sqrt(&lt;(r-&lt;r&gt;)^2&gt;) where the angle brackets denote
averaging over selected atoms. The averaging is mass-weighted if MASS
is TRUE. The factor FACT is subtracted from the masses before applying
the mass-weighting. The symbols $RG (radius of gyration), $XCM, $YCM,
$ZCM (center of mass) are declared (default for selected atoms: (ALL);
for MASS: FALSE; for FACT: 0.0).</LI>

<LI><B>RMS [SELEction atom-selection] [MASS=logical]</B> computes the
(mass-weighted if MASS is TRUE) rms difference for selected atoms
between the main and comparison set. The rms value is stored in the
symbol $RESULT. The individual atomic rms differences are stored in
the RMSD array (default for selection: (ALL); for MASS: FALSE).</LI>

<LI><B>ROTAte [SELEction=atom-selection] [CENTer=vector]
<matrix></B> rotates selected atoms around the specified rotation
center (default: ( 0 0 0 ) ). The rotation matrix is specified through
the matrix statement (default for selection: (ALL)).</LI>

<LI><B>SWAP [SELEction=atom-selection]</B> exchanges main and comparison
coordinate set, i.e., X,Y,Z ? XCOMP,YCOMP,ZCOMP; B,Q are unaffected
(default for selection: (ALL) ).</LI>

<LI><B>SYMMetry symmetry-operator [SELEction=atom-selection]</B>
applies the specified crystallographic symmetry operator to the
selected coordinates. The notation for the symmetry operator is the
same as in the International Tables for Crystallography (Hahn
ed. 1987), e.g., (- x, y+1/2, -z). The unit cell geometry needs to be
specified before invoking this statement. The coordinates are
converted into fractional coordinates before application of the
symmetry operator and converted back into orthogonal coordinates
afterward.</LI>

<LI><B>TRANslate [SELEction=atom-selection] VECTor=vector
[DISTance=real]</B> translates selected atoms by specified translation
vector. If DISTance is specified, the translation occurs along the
specified vector for the specified distance (default for selection:
(ALL) ).</LI>

</UL>

<P>Coordinates are also read using the COORdinate statement:</P>

<PRE>
  coordinates @file.pdb
</PRE>

<P>Coordinates can be read into different destination within CNS using
the DISPosition qualifier:</P>

<UL>
<LI>COORdinate [DISPosition= COMParison | DERIvative | MAIN | REFErence ] { pdb-records } END
</UL>

<P>This reads Brookhaven Data Bank formatted records consisting of
x,y,z coordinates, occupancies, and B-factors, while trying to match
the atom name, residue name, residue number, and segment name to the
internal molecular topology information. The coordinates are deposited
in the main (X,Y,Z,B,Q), comparison (XCOMP, YCOMP, ZCOMP, BCOMP,
QCOMP), reference (REFX, REFY, REFZ, HARM, HARM), or derivative (DX,
DY, DZ, FBETA, FBETA) coordinate arrays. The information is deposited
only if the atom has been selected. Note that the syntax is strict;
i.e., the SELEction and the DISPosition have to be specified before
one can read a <pdb-record>. Also, the PDB convention suggests an END
statement at the end of the file that will terminate the coordinate
statement (default for selected atoms: (ALL); for DISPosition:
MAIN).<P>

<P>According to the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, the entry for atoms
is defined as follows:</P>

<PRE>
ATOM    837 HG23 THR  1055      -8.573   5.657  -3.818  1.00  0.00      A    
HETATM 1223  O   GLY   153A    -11.704  -9.200    .489  1.00  0.80      1MOL
      uuuuu vvvv uuuuCuuuuI   vvvvvvvvuuuuuuuuvvvvvvvvuuuuuuvvvvvv      uuuu
        atom     residue          x      y        z     q      b        segid
     number name name number     
                          ^ insertion character 
                     ^ chain identifier 
            ^ additional character for some atom names (mostly h's) 
</PRE>

<P>CNS can use the chain identifier information at the stage of
molecular topology generation, but the information is stored
internally as a segment identifier - the characters in columns 73-76
are used for the segment name. The segment name has to match the
definition in the segment statement. The insertion character is
treated as part of the residue number (note: the residue number is a
string consisting of a maximum of four characters). CNS ignores any
reference to the atom numbers and instead generates its own numbering
scheme. The REMARK record of PDB files is treated as a title
record. No other type of PDB specification, such as SCALE, or SEQU, is
interpreted at present, but are ignored instead. Normally, CNS expects
orthogonal coordinates. The ORTHogonalize option can be used to
convert fractional coordinates into orthogonal &Aring; coordinates.</P>

<P>The PDB convention requires an END statement at the end of the
coordinate file. CNS uses the same convention. The inclusion of the
END statement implies that the coordinate statement must not be
terminated with an END statement from the main level of CNS. However,
if the END statement is missing in the coordinate file, parsing errors
will result.</P>

<U>Requirements</U>

<P>The molecular structure has to be defined before any coordinates can
be read and/or manipulated.</P>

<U>Examples</U>

<P>The first example reads the coordinates from two files into the
main and comparison sets:</P>

<PRE>
  coordinates @set1.pdb 

  coordinates disposition=comparison  @set2.pdb
</PRE>

<P>In the second example, the first set is least-squares fitted to the
second (comparison) set using Ca atoms only. Note that all atoms are
translated and rotated. Then the rms difference between the two sets
is computed for backbone atoms and stored in the symbol
$rms_backbone. Finally, the individual rms differ- ences are printed
for all backbone atoms that show rms differences greater than 1 &Aring;.</P>

<PRE>
  coordinates fit selection=( name ca ) end 
  coordinates rms selection=( name ca or name n or name c ) end 

  evaluate ($rms_backbone=$result) 

  show ( rmsd ) 
       ( attribute rmsd > 1.0 and ( name ca or name n or name c )) 
</PRE>

<P>In the third example, the main coordinates are fractionalized, a
translation and a rotation are applied, and the coordinates are
orthogonalized again. The rotation and translation is the space-group
operator (- x,y+1/2,-z).</P>

<PRE>
  xray a=94.5 b=65.3 c=67.2 alpha=90 beta=90 gamma=90 end

  coordinates fractionalize end 

  coordinates rotate 
     matrix=( -1  0  0  ) 
            (  0  1  0  ) 
            (  0  0 -1  ) 
  end 

  coordinates translate 
     vector=( 0 0.5 0 ) 
  end 

  coordinates orthogonalize end 
</PRE>

<P>The final example shows how to rotate the coordinates using
Eulerian angles:</P>

<PRE>
  coordinates rotate 
    euler=( 10., 30., 2. ) 
  end
