<H2>NCS restraints in refinement</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) can (and in many cases should) be
included in refinement. In CNS two models for NCS are available:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Strict (constraints) - the model consists of a protomer. Matrices
explicitly define the relationship between protomers. These matrices
are used to generate the complete asymmetric unit. The relationships
between protomers are fixed because the matrices do not change during
refinement. </LI>

<LI>Restrained (restraints) - the model consists of all protomers. The
relationship between protomers is defined by selections of equivalent
atoms. These relationships are used to superimpose all related
molecules and calculate deviations from the average structure. The
relationships between protomers are not fixed because the matrices
used to superimpose protomers are constantly changing during
refinement. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Non-crystallographic symmetry is defined with the CNS auxiliary
file <TT>ncs.def</TT>. This has sections for strict NCS and NCS
restraints (either one or the other can be used at a given
moment). Here we will perform refinement (simulated annealing, positional minimization, and B-factor refinement) for a model with
NCS restraints with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The model
consists of a dimer and the definition of NCS related atoms that is
used internally to superimpose the protomers and generate restraints
that maintain similarity between the two protomers. The NCS restraints
are defined with the CNS task file <A
HREF="ncs_restrain.def">ncs_restrain.def</A>.  To use NCS restraints
requires that coordinates are known for all the protomers. In this
case the two molecules in the dimer were located by molecular
replacement. The relationship between protomers is defined by the use
of atom selections:</P>

<P>The NCS restraint weight determines how strongly the protomers are
restrained to be similar. A value of 300 to 500 results in protomers
that are close to identical after superposition. A value of 10 puts
very little weight on the NCS restraints and large deviations between
related molecules are allowed. It is best to begin refinement with a
high weight (300) and use the free R-value the determine if a lower
weight is appropriate. After the NCS restraints have been defined a
round of simulated annealing is performed:</P>
   
<PRE>
      cns_solve &lt; <A HREF="refine.inp">refine.inp</A> &gt; refine.out
</PRE>

<P>Note that the model consists of residues 109 through 220 in each
protomer. However, it is clear from the electron density map that the
first 10 residues are in very different conformations in the two
protomers. Therefore these residues are excluded from the NCS
restraints.</P>
<P>The header of the resulting refine.pdb file starts with:</P>
<pre>REMARK coordinates from positional and B-factor refinement
REMARK cycles= 1
REMARK refinement resolution: 500 - 1.8 A
REMARK starting r= 0.4340 free_r= 0.4436
REMARK final    r= 0.3690 free_r= 0.4079
REMARK</pre>
<P>It also contains useful information about the NCS relationships for the refined model:</P>
<pre>REMARK ncs= restrain  ncs file= ncs_restrain.def
REMARK number of restrained NCS groups= 1
REMARK NCS group 1: number of NCS protomers= 2
REMARK    NCS operator 2 ( 2 -&gt; 1 ):
REMARK      matrix=  0.22453  0.25156 -0.94144
REMARK               0.32652 -0.92968 -0.17054
REMARK              -0.91813 -0.26911 -0.29088
REMARK      translation=   35.37103   31.80531   55.37670
REMARK      rms for xyz restraints=  0.03834
REMARK      rms for B restraints for this group= 1.59018
</pre>
<p><br>
  Both the coordinates and the B-factors are tightly restrained with the particular choice of NCS restraint weight and target sigma for NCS-related B values.</p>
