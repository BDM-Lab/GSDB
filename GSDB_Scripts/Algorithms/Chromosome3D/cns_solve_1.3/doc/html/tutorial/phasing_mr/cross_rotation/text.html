<H2>Cross-rotation search to determine rotation</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>
   
<P>The first part of the molecular replacement process is the rotation
search, which attempts to determine the correct rotational orientation
of the search model in the cell of the unknown structure.</P>

<P>The fast direct rotation search is used for this rotation
search. The output is a listing of rotation function peak height (in
this case the correlation coefficient between squared, normalized
structure factors) versus rotation angle (in Euler angles). In the
ideal case there is a clear separation between the correct and
incorrect solutions in the list, the correct solutions having the
highest correlation coefficients. However, if the search model has low
homology with the unknown structure, or the search model represents
only a fraction of the asymmetric unit contents, it is not uncommon
for no clear "top" solution to be present:</P>

<P>Although the correlation coefficients are small, there is a clear
gap between the top peak and the rest. This is usually a good
indication that a correct solution has been obtained. In this example
there is a dimer in the asymmetric unit but our search model contains
only one monomer, this leads us to expect two outstanding rotation
solution peaks (one for each monomer in the dimer). However, here we
see only one clear peak, probably due to differences (coordinates and
B-factors) in the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The
translation search will be used to determine which of the rotation
solutions correspond to the two monomers.</P>
