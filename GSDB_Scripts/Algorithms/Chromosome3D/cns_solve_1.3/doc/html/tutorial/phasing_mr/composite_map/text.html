<H2>Reducing model bias with the composite omit map</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>In order to reduce the effects of model bias a simulated annealing
omit map can be calculated. In the case of a molecular replacement
solution we cannot be sure which parts of the model are in error
therefore an omit map that covers the entire molecule is most
useful. It is not possible to exclude the entire model (at most 10%
can be omitted), instead small regions of the model are systematically
excluded. A small map is made covering the omitted region. These small
maps are accumulated and written out as a continuous map covering the
whole molecule (or the defined region). Simulated annealing refinement
and minimization are used to remove the bias from the omitted
region. A composite omit, cross-validated, sigma-A weighted map is
calculated using the CNS task file

<P>The map shows less bias in regions that are incorrectly placed.</P>
