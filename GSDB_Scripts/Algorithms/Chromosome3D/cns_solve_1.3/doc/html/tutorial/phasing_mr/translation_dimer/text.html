<H2>Translation search with a fixed molecule to complete dimer</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>
   
<P>The search model represents only approximately half of the contents
of the asymmetric unit. However, the location of one monomer is
already known (from the previous rotation/translation search). This
information can be used in the second translation search. The location
of the first molecule will remain fixed while the location of second
is tested for each rotation peak. Before this can be done, the 2 models must be merged into single
PDB. The coordinates for the top translation
search solution are used for the first molecule, while the starting
model is used for the second molecule. This is because the first
molecule will remain fixed in the subsequent translation search. With an editor you need to append both files and give the second model (the one that has the starting coordinates) a new segid, in this case it is segid &quot;B&quot;.</P>
<P>Once the coordinates have been merged with unique segids for each molecule, the final translation search
  can be performed. In the CNS task file it is possible to select those
  atoms which are to be used in structure factor calculation and also
those atoms which are to remain fixed during the translation search:</P>

<PRE>
{* select atoms to be used in the calculation of structure factors *}
{* this must include the molecule whose translation is unknown and
   any molecules whose translation is already known which will remain
   stationary during the translation search *}
{===>} atom_select=(known and (segid A or segid B));

{* select atoms of molecule(s) whose translation is already known *}
{* these atoms will not be translated during the translation search,
   but their position may be optimized during the final rigid body
   refinement *}
{===>} atom_placed=(segid A);
</PRE>

<P>Before and after the translation search the rotational orientation
of the search model is optimized by Patterson-Correlation (PC)
refinement.</P>

<P>The translation search shows one solution with a significantly
higher correlation coefficient than the other solutions (solution 8):</P>

<P>It is also important to note that the correlation coefficient
increased signficantly compared to the first translation search with
only one molecule. The packing value is at a maxmimum indicating
minimimal overlap for this solution compared to the others.</P>

<P>Visual inspection of the best solution shows that the two molecules
are separated in space. It is best to automatically relocate the
molecules so they are close together in space (making graphics work
easier). This can be done by applying crystallograpic symmetry and
unit cell translations in order to maximize the surface area buried
between the two molecules. This is performed with the CNS task file
<TT>shift_molecules.inp</TT>:</P>

<P>After repositioning of the molecules a compact dimer can be seen:</P>
