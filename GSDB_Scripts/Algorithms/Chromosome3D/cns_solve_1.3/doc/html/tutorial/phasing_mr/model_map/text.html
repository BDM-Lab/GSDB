<H2>Calculating a cross-validated sigma-A weighted electron density map</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>An electron density map can be calculated using the phases from the
model obtained by molecular replacement. Ideally this will show
regions of the model which are in error - either missing or misplaced
atoms. A cross-validated, sigma-A weighted map is calculated using the
CNS task file <TT>model_map.inp</TT>:</P>

</PRE>

<P>Overall the map is good, but there are some regions in which the
density is poor. This is because there are differences between the
search model and the true structure and also differences between the
two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In particular the N-terminal
residues in the two monomers adopt very different conformations. The
poor density in this region in molecule B suggests that these residues
may initially need to be omitted from refinement.</P>
