<H2>Translation search to determine translation</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>
   
<P>The rotations identified in the rotation search are applied to the
search molecule and the translational position in the unit cell is
determined. Only those rotation peaks which produce a significant
translation function peak will be considered to be correct. Before and
after the translation search the roational orientation of the search
model is optimized by Patterson-Correlation (PC) refinement. All of
these procedures are localized in the CNS task file
<TT>translation.inp</TT>. Translation searches are performed for the
top 10 cross rotation peaks.</P>

<P>The translation search produces a listing which details the
rotational parameters for the search model after final PC refinement,
the translation of the molecule (in orthogonal &Aring;), the value
of the translation search scoring function, and the packing value
(this the percentage of the unit cell covered by the molecule):</P>

<P>There is one solution with a correlation coefficient (in this case
E2E2) which is significantly higher than all other solutions (0.286
with the next closest peak 0.229). The packing value is also high,
indicating minimal overlap of the molecule with itself. The
translation search writes out rotated and translated coordinates for
all rotation peaks tested. The solution with the highest correlation
coefficient is also written out as the best answer. In this example
the top rotation solution peak corresponds to a correct orientation
for the molecule. This is not always the case and several rotation
solutions may need to be tested to find a correct translation
solution. It is feasible to test many rotation solutions because of
the fast translation search. In difficult cases it may be useful to
test all peaks found in the cross-rotation search.</P>
