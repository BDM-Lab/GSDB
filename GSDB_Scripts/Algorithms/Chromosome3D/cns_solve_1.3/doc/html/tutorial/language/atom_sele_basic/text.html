<H3><U>Selecting atoms</U></H3>

<P>Selecting atoms in CNS is performed using a matching
operation. This means that an expression is written which is matched
against the properties of the atoms currently stored in memory. Those
atoms which match the expression are selected.</P>

<P>Selections may be simple, selecting atoms on the basis of residue
number for example. However, the creation of more complex expressions
requires the combination of one or more simple expressions with the
operators <TT>AND</TT>, <TT>OR</TT> and <TT>NOT</TT>. The meaning of
these basic operators must be understood for construction of
meaningful selection expressions.</P>

<P><B>OR</B>: The union between the two sets of atoms selected in
the two enclosing expressions.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
      (segid A <TT>or</TT> residue 10)
</PRE>
<P>All atoms which have the segid A <B>OR</B> the residue number 10
are selected. This would select all atoms with the segid A and also
any atoms which have the residue number 10.</P>
   
<P><B>AND</B>: The intersection between the two sets of atoms
selected in the two enclosing expressions.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
      (segid A <TT>and</TT> residue 10)
</PRE>
<P>All atoms which have the segid A <B>AND</B> the residue number 10
are selected. This would only select those atoms which have both the
segid A and the residue number 10.</P>

<P><B>NOT</B>: All atoms outside the set of atoms selected in the
following expression.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
      (<TT>not</TT> (residue 10))
</PRE>
<P>All atoms which do not have the residue number 10 are selected.</P>

<P>Simple expressions are grouped using parentheses to make clear the
order of selection.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
      ((segid A <TT>or</TT> residue 10) <TT>and</TT> resname TYR)
</PRE>
<P>This would select any atoms with either segid A or residue number
10, which also have the residue name TYR. This should be compared
with:</P>
<PRE>
      (segid A <TT>or</TT> (residue 10 <TT>and</TT> resname TYR))
</PRE>
<P>This would select all atoms with segid A, and also any atoms which
have residue number 10 and residue name TYR.</P>

<H4>Examples</H4>

<P>Please see the syntax manual for a full description of the atom
selection syntax. Below are some examples which cover many of the
common atom selection concepts.</P>

<LI>Selection of all atoms:</LI>
<UL>
(all)
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection of no atoms:</LI>
<UL>
(none)
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection of all atoms whose coordinates are known:</LI>
<UL>
(known)
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection of all atoms whose coordinates are not known:</LI>
<UL>
(not(known))
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection of all hydrogen atoms (selects all atoms with a mass of
1 AMU):</LI>
<UL>
(hydrogen)
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection by segid:</LI>
<UL>
(segid A)
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection by range of segids (all atoms with a segid between A and
D inclusive are selected):</LI>
<UL>
(segid A:D)
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection by residue number:</LI>
<UL>
(residue 10)
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection by a range of residue numbers (all atoms with their
residue number between 10 and 50 inclusive are selected):</LI>
<UL>
(residue 10:50)
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection by residue name (selects all atoms with the name
MET):</LI>
<UL>
(resname MET)
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection by atom name (selects all atoms with the name CA):</LI>
<UL>
(name CA)
</UL>
   
<LI>Selection by chemical type (selects all atoms with the chemical
type ZN):</LI>
<UL>
(chemical ZN)
</UL>

<LI>Selection by atom id (should only be used when the id has been
returned by a previous <TT>show</TT> expression or inside a <TT>FOR
$ID IN ID</TT> loop construct):</LI>
<UL>
(id 100)
</UL>

<LI>Selection of all atoms in a residue given a subset of atoms unique
to that residue:</LI>
<UL>
(byresidue(residue 10 and name CA))
</UL>

<LI>Selection of all atoms bonded to an atom:</LI>
<UL>
(bondedto(residue 10 and name CA))
</UL>

<LI>Selection of one unique atom per residue (the <TT>TAG</TT>
modifier selects only one atom per residue):</LI>
<UL>
(tag and (residue 10:50))
</UL>

<LI>Selection of all atoms within a specified distance of another atom
selection (atoms within 5.0 &Aring; of any atom in the preceeding
selection are selected):</LI>
<UL>
((residue 10 and name CA) around 5.0)
</UL>

<LI>Selection of all atoms within a specified distance of another atom
selection taking into account crystallographic symmetry (atoms within
5.0 &Aring; of any atom or its symmetry mate in the preceeding
selection are selected):</LI>
<UL>
((residue 10 and name CA) saround 5.0)
</UL>

<H3><U>Atomic attributes</U></H3>

<P>Selections can also be made on the basis of atomic attributes such
as coordinates or B-factors. The <TT>ATTRIBUTE</TT> operator is
used:</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
      (attribute(b > 50))
</PRE>
<P>All atoms which have an atomic B-factor greater than 50 are
selected.</P>

<H4>Examples</H4>

<P>Please see the syntax manual for a full description of the
attribute syntax and the full set of atomic attributes which can be
used for selection. Below are some examples which cover many of the
common attribute concepts.</P>

<LI>Selection of all atoms whose X coordinates are equal to 0:</LI>
<UL>
(atttribute(x = 0))
</UL>

<LI>Selection of all atoms whose B-factors are not equal to 0:</LI>
<UL>
(atttribute(b # 0))
</UL>

<LI>Selection of all atoms whose masses are greater than 20:</LI>
<UL>
(atttribute(mass > 20))
</UL>

<LI>Selection of all atoms whose charges are negative:</LI>
<UL>
(atttribute(charge < 0))
</UL>

<P>Note that all attribute operators are single character only, there
are no such operators as <TT><=</TT> or <TT>>=</TT>. A compound
expression must be used instead:</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
      (attribute(b = 50) or attribute(b > 50))
</PRE>
<P>All atoms which have an atomic B-factor greater than or equal to 50
are selected.</P>

<H3><U>Complex selections</U></H3>

<P>Selection expressions can be compounded to form more complex
expressions.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
      (attribute(b > 50) and (segid A <TT>or</TT> residue 10))
</PRE>
<P>All atoms which have an atomic B-factor greater than 50 and segid A
or residue number 10 are selected.</P>

<H4>Examples</H4>

<LI>Selection of atoms in the mainchain of a protein:</LI>
<UL>
(name N or name CA or name C or name O)
</UL>

<LI>Selection of atoms in a protein which are equivalent to
poly-alanine:</LI>
<UL>
(name N or name CA or name C or name O or name CB)
</UL>

atoms in the protein sidechains, and any atoms not in protein):</LI>
<UL>

</UL>

<LI>Selection of non-hydrogen atoms whose coordinates are known:</LI>
<UL>

are within a 5 &Aring; radius of residue 10 in segid B:</LI>
<UL>
