<P>In general, a statement in CNS can be a control statement or an
application statement. A control statement allows structured control
of the sequence of application statements, such as loops, and
conditional tests. It also allows switching the input stream to
another file, opening and closing files, and various other
operations. Control statements form the basis of the CNS scripting
language and are as follows:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>@ filename</B> deals with the fact that initially the
parser reads from standard input. The stream can be switched to
another file by using this statement. Upon end of file, the parsing
stream is switched back to the previous input. Nested streams are
allowed.</LI>

<LI><B>@@ filename</B> has the same effect as the "@" statement,
except when the stream file is invoked within a structured loop
statement. In this case, the "@" statement inserts the contents of
file filename into the loop and removes the statement in subsequent
loop cycles, whereas the "@@" statement reads from filename each time
the loop hits the statement. It should be noted that filename can be a
symbol. This allows one to loop through a set of different filenames.
Nested "@@" statements are allowed. Most of the time the @ filename statement should be used. The only exception arises when different files (e.g. separate coordinates, parameter or topology files) are to be read within a loop. Here is an example:
  <pre> topology
    evaluate ($counter=1)
    evaluate ($done=false)
    while ( $done = false ) loop read
       if ( &amp;exist_topology_infile_$counter = true ) then
          if ( &amp;BLANK%topology_infile_$counter = false ) then
             @@&amp;topology_infile_$counter
          end if
        else
           evaluate ($done=true)
        end if
        evaluate ($counter=$counter+1)
    end loop read
end </pre>
  <p><br>
    <br>
    One cannot use the @ filename statement here since this would read the first file over and over again. There is a drawback of using the @@ filename statement: it does not allow the use of loop statements inside the file. </p>
</LI>

<LI><B>INLIne @ filename</B> inserts the contents of the file into the
  command stack but does not change the current scope.</LI>

<LI><B>ABORt</B> stop program execution.</LI>

<LI><B>BUFFer buffername {buffer-statement} END</B> writes text to or
manipulates text in an internal buffer with the name buffername. See
the syntax manual for further information.</LI>

<LI><B>CLOSe filename DISPosition=KEEP|DELEte END</B> explicitly
closes a specified file. Normally this operation is done automatically
by CNS, so this statement should be used only in rare cases, such as
closing and deleting a file.</LI>

<LI><B>DEFIne ( { parameter=string[newline string]; } )</B> defines a
parameter. The named parameter is assigned the string verbatim after
symbol substitution. The string can extend over many lines (these
linebreaks will be inserted into the parameter). A parameter can be
referenced using an ampersand (eg. &parameter). Parameters cannot be
modified, they however can be overwritten by a new define
statement.</LI>

<LI><B>DISPLAY record</B> writes the record to a file that is
specified by the "SET DISPlay" statement. The record can be any
sequence of characters terminated by a carriage return. It may contain
symbols that are substituted before the record is written to the
file. Symbols can be output with formatting, specified by the FORTRAN
format syntax (eg. display $number[f8.3]). </LI>

<LI><B>EVALuate evaluate-statement</B> manipulates symbols (see
below).</LI>

<LI><B>FILEExist filename END</B> checks to see if the specified file
exists. The symbol $RESULT is set to logical true if the file exists,
false otherwise.</LI>

<LI><B>FOR symbol IN ( { wordlist } ) basic-loop</B> assigns
the symbol to a word from the wordlist (one at a time) and executes
the statements within the basic loop.</LI>

<LI><B>FOR symbol IN ID atom-selection basic-loop</B>
assigns the symbol to the internal atom identifier for all atoms in
the selection, and executes the statements within the basic loop. Care
should be taken not to modify the internal molecular topology within
the scope of the basic loop. The selection for the symbol is stored
and computed when the loop is initialized, and it is not mapped when
atom numbers change.</LI>

<LI><B>IF condition THEN CNS-statement [{ ELSEIF condition
THEN CNS-statement }] [ ELSE CNS-statement ] END IF</B>
depending on the conditions, sends control flow to the appropriate
branch.</LI>

<LI><B>OPEN filename FORMatted = FORMATTED | UNFORMATTED ACCESS =
READ | WRITE | APPEND END</B> explicitly opens the specified
file. Normally, this operation is done automatically by CNS, and so
the statement should be used only in rare cases, such as opening a
file with append access.</LI>

<LI><B>REMARKS record</B> writes the record to an internal title
store. The record can be any sequence of characters terminated by a
carriage return. It can contain symbols that are substituted before
the record is stored. The internal title store is written to the first
lines of output files.</LI>

<LI><B>REWInd filename END</B> rewinds the specified file.</LI>

<LI><B>SET set-statement END</B> sets various global parameters and
options.</LI>

<LI><B>SYSTEM command</B> issues a shell command (this is not possible
on some systems).</LI>

<LI><B>WHILe condition basic-loop</B> while the condition is true,
executes the statements within the basic loop.</LI>

<LI><B>{ string [newline string] }</B> text between the braces is
ignored as a comment.</LI>

<LI><B>! string</B> text on the line after the exclamation point is
ignored as a comment.</LI>

</UL>

<P>A condition takes the form:</P>

<B>( word = | # | &gt; | &lt; | GE | LE word )</B>

<P>A condition is true if the first word is equal to, not equal to,
greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or
equal to the second word, respectively.</P>

<P> A basic loop takes the form:</P>

<B>LOOP label { <CNS-statement> [EXIT label] } END LOOP label</B>

<P>The label is a string with up to four characters. The EXIT
statement allows jumping out of the specified loop (and should be part
of a conditional statement). Loops may be nested.</P>

<U>Example: A Conditional Test</U>

<P>This example either divides or multiplies the symbol $1 by a factor
of two, depending on the value of the NOE energy ($NOE). In the first
case, 40 steps of minimization are carried out, whereas in the latter
case, 100 steps of minimization are carried out. Note that the
indentation is arbitrary but can make the input file more readable.</P>

<PRE>
if ($NOE > 10.0) then 
   evaluate ($1=$1/2.0) 
   minimize powell 
     nstep=40 
   end 
else 
   evaluate ($1=$1*2.0) 
   minimize powell 
     nstep=100 
   end 
end if 
</PRE>

<U>Example: A Simple Loop</U>

<P>The following example writes the characters a, b, c, d, and e to
the file called testing.dat (the case is preserved).</P>

<PRE>
set display=testing.dat end 
for $1 in ( a b c d e ) loop main 
   display  $1 
end loop main 
</PRE>

<U>Example: A Double Loop with Exit Condition</U>

<P>The conditional statement forces exit from both loops if the condition is satisfied.</P>

<PRE>
for $1 in ( a b c d e ) loop m1 
  while ($2 > 10.0 ) loop m2 
     if ($3>1000.0) then  exit  m1  end if 
     evaluate ($2=$2-1.0) 
  end loop m2 
end loop m1 
</PRE>

<U>Example: Switch Control to Another File</U>

<P>Suppose the file called "mini.str" contains the following
statements:</P>

<PRE>
minimize powell 
   nstep=40.0 
end 
</PRE>

<P>One can then include the contents of this file in another file by
specifying the "@" statement; e.g.,</P>

<PRE>
@mini.str 
</PRE>

<P>is equivalent to</P>

<PRE>
minimize powell 
   nstep=40.0 
end 
</PRE>

<U>Example: Switch Control to Another File within Loops</U>

<P>When CNS executes loops, it stores all input information in
internal buffers. This may not be desirable if one wants to loop
through several files. To do this, one should use the "@@"
statement. In the following example, four coordinate files are
rms-compared to a set of reference coordinates:</P>

<PRE>
coordinate disposition=comp @reference.pdb 

for $1 in ( "coor1.pdb" "coor2.pdb" "coor3.pdb" "coor4.pdb" ) loop main 
   coordinate @@$1 
   coordinate rms end 
end loop main 
</PRE>


<U>Symbols</U>

<P>A symbol is a word with a "$" as the first character. It is
replaced by another word that has been assigned by the user or by CNS
during program execution. Symbols can be assigned an arbitrary value
and manipulated by the evaluate statement and several control
statements. The data type can be real, string, logical or complex and
is assigned automatically by the program. The name of the symbol is a
string that qualifies as a word with fewer than 20 characters. Symbols
can also be compound, that is sublevels are delimited by a point
(eg. $number.1 $number.2 $number.total). CNS internally declares
particular symbols when certain statements are executed. Here are a
few examples:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>$NAME</B> is declared during CNS start-up. It contains the
username (string).</LI>

<LI><B>$SYSTEM</B> is declared during CNS start-up. It contains the
system identification (string).</LI>

<LI><B>$TIME</B> contains the wall-clock time (string).</LI>

<LI><B>$CPU</B> contains the CPU time (real).</LI>

<LI><B>$DATE</B> contains the current date (string).</LI>

<LI><B>$CURBYTES</B> contains the current memory usage (string).</LI>

<LI><B>$MAXBYTES</B> contains the maximum memory usage (string).</LI>

<LI><B>$CUROVERH</B> contains the current memory overhead (string).</LI>

<LI><B>$MAXOVERH</B> contains the maximum memory overhead (string).</LI>

<LI><B>$EFLAG.[energy-term]</B> which energy terms are currently active (logical).</LI>

<LI><B>$ANGL, $BOND, $DG, $DIHE, $ELEC, $ENER, $HARM, $IMPR, $NCS,
$NOE, $PELE, $PLAN, $PVDW, $VDW, $XREF</B> represent partial energy
terms. The data type is real. These symbols are declared upon
evaluation of the CNS energy function.</LI>

<LI><B>$EXIST_symbol-name</B> is not an assignable symbol; it is a
special symbol that returns the logical true if the symbol with name
symbol-name has been declared previously; otherwise it returns logical
false.</LI>

<LI><B>$GRAD</B> specifies the rms value of the energy gradient. The
data type is real. This symbol is declared upon execution of the CNS
energy function.</LI>

<LI><B>$KBOLTZ</B> is declared during CNS start-up. It contains the
Boltzmann constant in units of the program (real).</LI>

<LI><B>$PI</B> is declared during CNS start-up. It contains the value
of pi (real).</LI>

<LI><B>$RESULT</B> contains the results after execution of various
statements. Data type is either real or string, depending on the
application.</LI>

<LI><B>$?</B> is not an assignable symbol; it produces a list of the
currently assigned symbols.</LI>

</UL>

<U>Example</U>

<P>In the following example, a symbol $weight is declared. Note that
CNS automatically determines the type of the symbol. This symbol is
used in the subsequent statements. The third statement declares a
symbol $root_weight.</P>

<PRE>
  evaluate ($weight=3.40+433^2) 

  xray wa=$weight end 

  evaluate ($root_weight=sqrt($weight)) 
</PRE>

<P>In the next line, the symbol $root_weight is redeclared as a
character string.</P>

<PRE>
  evaluate ($root_weight="testing 1 2 3") 
</PRE>

<P>As a consequence of this statement, $EXIST_root_weight is set to
logical true.</P>

<P>Here, the compound symbols $total.number, $total.1 and $total.2 are
declared as real.</P>

<PRE>
  evaluate ($total.number=10)
  evaluate ($total.1=230)
  evaluate ($total.2=178)
</PRE>

<U>Parameters</U>

<P>Parameters are assigned with the define statement. The named
parameter is assigned the string verbatim after symbol
substitution. The string can extend over many lines (these linebreaks
will be inserted into the parameter). A parameter can be referenced
using an ampersand (eg. &parameter). Parameters cannot be modified,
they however can be overwritten by a new define statement. Parameter
names can be a maximum of 80 characters.</P>

<U>Examples</U>

<P>A parameter named weight is assigned the value 10:</P>

<PRE>
  define ( weight=10; )
</PRE>

<P>A parameter named comment is assigned a string value:</P>

<PRE>
  define ( comment="this is a text comment
                    that goes over more than one line"; )
</PRE>

<P>Two parameters are assigned in the same define statement:</P>

<PRE>
  define ( weight=10; 
           comment="this is a text comment
                    that goes over more than one line"; )
</PRE>

<P>The parameter weight is used in:</P>

<PRE>
  define ( weight=10; )
  evaluate ( $new_weight= &weight * 30.0 )
  xray
    wa = &weight
  end
</PRE>

<U>Modules and procedures</U>

<P>Modules and procedures are mechanisms to isolate common tasks in a
well defined way such they can be readily used by several task
files. They are analogous to subroutines or functions in lower-level
programming languages such as FORTRAN or C (although the syntax and
specifics differ).</P>

<P><B>Modules:</B> reside in separate text files and are called using
the stream redirection facility in CNS.</P>

<PRE>
  @getweight ( selected=(residue 10:60);
               fixed=(residue 45);
               wa=wa_new; )
</PRE>

<P>The module file itself begins with the declaration of the expected
parameters. The declaration may define defaults for the parameters (in
the case that they are not passed when the module is called). The
module is called with the appropriate parameters (see above):</P>

<PRE>
module {getweight}
(
  &selected=(all);
  &fixed=(none);
  &wa=$wa_temp;
)
</PRE>

<P>In the body of the module an reference to a passed parameter
(eg. &selected) will be substituted with the value of the parameter
from the module invocation. In this case any instance of &selected
would be substituted with (residue 10:60). Modules have scope, that
is, when a module is called any symbols created in the module have a
new scope.</P>

<P><B>Procedures:</B> are defined within the body of a CNS task file
(or can be kept in a separate library file which is read by the task
file upon start up). Procedures are very similar to modules expect
that they are defined and invoked from the level of the task file. The
procedure declaration again defines the expected parameters:</P>

<PRE>
procedure set_target (target_label)
  if     (&target_label="f2f2") then
    display set_target: target defined to be f2f2
  else
    display set_target: fatal error: unsupported target_label.
    abort
  end if
endprocedure
</PRE>

<P>The procedure is then called using the call statement:</P>

<PRE>
  call set_target (target_label=&pc_target;)
</PRE>

<P>As with modules the parameters in the body of the procedure
definition are substituted by the passed parameter values. A new scope
level is used for the procedure.</P>

<U>Wildcards</U>

<P>Another special case of a word is a wildcard which can take the
following forms:</P>

<PRE>
* | % | # | +
</PRE>

<P>where</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>*</B> matches any string.</LI>
<LI><B>%</B> matches a single character.</LI>
<LI><B>#</B> matches any number.</LI>
<LI><B>+</B> matches any digit.</LI>
</UL>

<U>Example</U>

<P>The following atom selection selects all atoms that contain a "C"
in their names at any position:</P>

<PRE>
 ( name *C* ) 
</PRE>

<U>Filenames</U>

<P>A filename is any sequence of nonblank characters enclosed by
spaces. In particular, the filename may contain one-character words,
and it is case sensitive.</P>

<U>Example</U>

<P>The following statements assign the specified files to the DISPlay
unit:</P>

<PRE>
 set display=display.list end 

 set display=/home/sub/testing.test end 
</PRE>

<P>On all UNIX and Windows systems, CNS provides the feature of
environmental variables. Suppose the user has defined a UNIX variable
MYDIR in his/her ".cshrc" file.</P>

<PRE>
  setenv MYDIR  /home/paul/project 
</PRE>

<P>Then it is possible to access a file "coordinates.pdb" in the
directory "/home/paul/project" in CNS by specifying the filename
"MYDIR:coordinates.pdb", e.g., if the user wants to set the DISPLay
file,</P>

<PRE>
  set display= MYDIR:coordinates.pdb
</PRE>

<P>The same feature can be used on Windows systems:</P>

<PRE>
  set MYDIR=C:\Paul\Project
</PRE>

<U>Set Statement</U>

<P>The set statement allows one to change certain parameters that
control CNS program execution and output.  The following is a list of
the available statements:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>ABORt=OFF|NORMal|ALL</B> determines whether program execution
will be terminated in batch mode if an error is encountered. OFF means
no termination in any case, NORMal means program terminates except in
the case of minor errors, and ALL means program always terminates if
an error is encountered. In interactive mode, i.e., if the error
occurs due to a statement that was typed interactively, the error
message will be printed without program termination (default:
normal).</LI>

<LI><B>DISPlay-file=filename</B> specifies an output file for DISPlay
statement. The display output can be redirected to the standard output
by specifying "SET DISPlay=OUTPUT END" (default: OUTPUT).</LI>

<LI><B>ECHO=ON|OFF</B> determines whether the input stream will be
echoed to standard output. ON means input stream is echoed; OFF means
echo is turned off. In interactive mode, the echo is always turned
off.</LI>

<LI><B>INTEractive=ON|OFF</B> deals with the fact that normally CNS
automatically determines whether the input comes from an interactive
device. This flag overules the automatic assignment. Statements that
are affected are ECHO and ABORt (default: depends on input
device).</LI>

<LI><B>JOURnal=filename</B> specifies a log-file for an interactive
session. This statement allows one to specify a journal file during an
interactive session that contains all statements that were typed
(default: none).</LI>

<LI><B>MESSage=OFF|NORMal|ALL</B> determines whether messages will be
printed. OFF means only very important messages are printed. NORMal
means most messages will be printed. ALL means all messages will be
printed.</LI>

<LI><B>PRECision=integer</B> specifies the number of significant
digits for substitution of symbols representing real numbers to
output; this does not affect the internal precision of the
calculations (default: 6).</LI>

<LI><B>PRINt-file=filename</B> specifies an output file for all PRINt
statements (default: OUTPUT).</LI>

<LI><B>SEED=real</B> is a seed for CNS's internal random-number
generator . It can be any positive real number.</LI>

<LI><B>TIMing=ON|OFF</B> determines whether timing information is
given for benchmarking CNS. ON means timing information is given; OFF
means no timing information is given (default: OFF).</LI>

</UL>

<U>Evaluate Statement</U>

<P>The evaluate statement allows one to carry out manipulations of
symbols together with literal or numerical constants:</P>

<PRE>
  evaluate ( symbol = operation )
</PRE>

<P>Where operation is:</P>

<PRE>
  function|symbol|real|integer|string [ op operation ]</B>
</PRE>

<P>and op is:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>+</B> denotes addition or concatenation for strings.</LI>
<LI><B>-</B> denotes subtraction or unary minus or negative concatenation for strings.</LI>
<LI><B>*</B> denotes multiplication.</LI>
<LI><B>/</B> denotes division.</LI>
<LI><B>^</B> denotes exponentiation.</LI>
<LI><B>**</B> denotes exponentiation (same as ^).</LI>
</UL>

<P>The data types of the operations and operands have to match;
otherwise an error message is issued. The available functions, such as
SIN, COS, and TAN, are the same as those for atomic manipulations (see
other documentation pages).</P>

<U>Example</U>

<P>The statement</P>

<PRE>evaluate ($1=1.0)</PRE>

<P>sets the symbol $1 to 1.0, whereas</P>

<PRE>evaluate ($1=$1+2.2)</PRE>

<P>increases it by 2.2,</P>

<PRE>evaluate ($1=$1*cos(2.*$pi$1))</PRE>

<P>sets it to 3.00498, and</P>

<PRE>evaluate ($2="a"+"b"+encode($1))</PRE>

<P>sets the symbol $2 to the string "ab3.00498".</P>
