Please see the HTML documentation for detailed installation instructions
and trouble shooting information. To install on any platform:

- cd to the CNSsolve directory
- modify the file cns_solve_env to define the location of CNSsolve 
  (alternatively, you may use the Bourne shell script cns_solve_env_sh, 
   but note that this script has not been thoroughly tested)
- type 'make install'
- source cns_solve_env prior to using CNSsolve
