<xray-peakpick-statement> :==

  from=<real-space-object>
  --{Real space object to pick peaks from.}
  mpeak=<integer>
  --{Number of peaks to pick. Default=100}
  selection=<map-selection>
  --{Map points to pick peaks from. Default=(all)}
  output=<filename>
  --{Output to write picked peaks. Default=output}
  proximity=<atom-selection>
  --{Atom selection around which picked peaks will be mapped.
     Symmetry and lattice operations are applied to the selected
     peaks in order to find the symmetry-related peak closest to the
     atoms selected by proximity. Default=(none)}
  atom=<logical>
  --{Create a dummy atom for each peak. Interpolated coordinates are
     stored in x, y and z, the interpolated height is stored in the
     B-factor array. <segid> <resname> <type> and <atom> are all set to PEAK.
     The residue numbers run from 1 to the number of peaks picked.
     Default=false}
  symbols=<logical>
  --{Declare symbols for each peak picked. Default=false
     symbols are: $peak_x $peak_y $peak_z $peak_height
     The number of peaks picked is always declared in $npeaks.}
  fractional=<logical>
  --{Output peaks in fractional coordinates. Default=false}
