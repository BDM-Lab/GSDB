  message=off|normal|all|debug
  --{Determines whether messages will be printed.
     - off=only very important messages are printed.
     - normal=most important messages will be printed.
     - all=all messages will be printed.
     - debug=all messages and debugging messages will be printed.}
  abort=off|normal|all
  --{Determines whether program execution will be terminated in 
     batch mode if an error is encountered.
     - off=no termination.
     - normal=program terminates except in the case of minor errors.
     - all=program always terminates if an error is encountered. If 
       the error occurs due to a command that was typed interactively
       the error message will be printed without program termination.}
  echo=on|off
  --{Determines whether the input is echoed to the output.
     - on=input stream is echoed to standard output.
     - off=input stream echo is turned off.
     In interactive mode the echo is always turned off.}
  timing=on|off
  --{Determines whether timing information is printed.
     - on=informative timing information is given for benchmarking.
     - off=no timing information is given.}
  interactive=on|off
  --{Normally it is automatically determined whether the input comes
     from an interactive device. This flag overrules the automatic
     assignment. Commands that are affected are echo and termination.}
  remarks=reset
  --{Reset remarks buffer.}
  remarks=accumulate
  --{Set remarks buffer to accumulate mode.}
  remarks=auto
  --{Set remarks buffer to automatic mode. This is the default.}
  display_file=<filename>
  --{Output file for display command.}
  print_file=<filename>
  --{Output file for print commands.}
  precision=<integer>
  --{Precision for printing of symbol with type real.}
  seed=<real>
  --{Seed for random number generator.}
  journal=<filename>
  --{Log-file for interactive session.}
