  --{Print current parameters and options.}
  drop=<real>
  --{Expected initial drop in energy (only for POWELL method). Default=10}
  nstep=<integer>
  --{Number of conjugate gradient steps. Default=0}
  tolerance=<real>
  --{Minimum gradient that forces exit of optimization. Default=0.000001}

  --{For LBFGS method only: Maximum number of energy evalulations during 
     line search. Default=10}

  rweight=<real>
  --{Weight for B-factor restraints. If negative, weight will be set
     automatically. If zero, no restraints will be computed. Default=-1}
  bsigma <atom-selection> <real>
  --{Target standard-deviation between B-factors of selected bonded atoms.}
  asigma <atom-selection> <real>
  --{Target standard-deviation between B-factors of selected 
     terminal atoms in angles.}
  group <atom-selection> 
  --(defines a grouped B-factor constraint: the B-factor change will be 
     constrained to be identical for all selected atom. Multiple groups 
     can be specified.) 
  bmin=<real>

  --{Note:
     - B-factor restraints are imposed as suggested by Konnert and
       Hendrickson. Backbone and sidechain B-factor restraints can be
       assigned by using multiple asigma, bsigma assignments.
     - B-factors will only be refined for atoms that are both selected
       in the xray target and are also free to move (i.e. not fixed).
     - The weights for ncs restraints are specified in the
       <ncs-restraints-statement>.
     - The following symbols are declared:
         $brms_bond     - overall rmsd for bond b restraints
         $bn_bond       - total number of bond b restraints
         $ngroup_bond   - number of groups of bond restraints
         $brms_bond_$k  - rmsd for bond b restraints for group k
         $bn_bond_$k    - number of bond b restraints for group k
         $ngroup_angl   - number of groups of angle restraints
         $brms_angl     - overall rmsd for angle b restraints
         $bn_angl       - total number of angle restraints
         $brms_angl_$k  - rmsd for angle b restraints for group k
         $bn_angl_$k    - number of angle b restraints for group k
