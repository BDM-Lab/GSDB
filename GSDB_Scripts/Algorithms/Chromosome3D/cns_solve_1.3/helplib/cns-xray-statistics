  --{Multiple expressions may be specified. Expressions must be 
     of type real. The following symbols are defined for the highest
     resolution shell: $expression1 .. $expression<n>
     The number of reflections selected is returned in: $reflections}
  output=<filename>
  --{Destination for statistics printout. Default=output}

  --{Structure factors to analyse. Default=(all)
     i.e. any reflection for which there is at least one observation.}
  completeness
  --{Ratio of selected to theoretically possible reflections in
     each resolution bin.}

  --{if overall is specified, bins=1 is used for all expressions and
     the statistical breakdown. This means that overall statistical
     quantities are produced for the specified binresolution range.
     If overall is not specified, the analysis is broken down into
     resolution shells (determined by the current number of bins).}

  -- Declares variables $expression1, $expression2, ...
     for highest resolution bin.  $reflections contains the
     number of reflections in that bin.

     Also declaures the compound symbols:
      $statistics.nbins
      $statistics.<i>.nref
      $statistics.<i>,high
      $statistics.<i>.low
      $statistics.<i>.value
     for the first "expression".
