     rmsd: stores the minimum nonbonded distance for each atom in

     print: writes all selected nonbonded distances to the specified 
            output file.
     den: generates DEN distance assignments and writes them to 
          specified file.
     matrix: stores all selected, nonbonded distances in a matrix and 
             then writes the matrix to the specified output file.}
