This is an unsupported host, but CNS 1.3 was built and underwnt minimal
testing successfully. These instructions are a bit detailed, but have not
been carefully reviewed. Send feedback to Joe Krahn <krahn@niehs.nih.gov>

Cygwin provides a 32-bit Gnu/Linux compatible environment, including
gfortran and OpenMP supports.  The standard 32-bit Linux build files
should work as-is, with a few exceptions noted below.  Currently, there
is no 64-bit Cygwin, so it still runs in 32-bit mode in 64-bit Windows.

If you want to do serious work on an MS-Windows system, consider
installing a virtual Linux instead.  Sun's VirtualBox works very well
and is free for non-commercial use, and is a good option for a personal
Windows laptop.

Windows is much slower at starting executables, so scripts that run
numerous commands, such as cns_solve_env, are rather slow.

*** Redistribution ***

The Cygwin GPL license does not allow CNS executables to be redsistributed.
There is an example Makefile header for MinGW, which can be redistributed.
They seem to work OK, but do not support OpenMP. To use the MinGW executables
from a standard DOS command shell, use cns_solve_env.bat from the windows-nt
machine directory to set up the environment.

NOTE: MinGW fails on the compiler test due to CR/LF line endings.
To fix this, edit compiler-test/Makefile, and change both instances of:
   tr -d " "
to:
   tr -d " \r"
This will not interfere with the Cygwin builds.

*** Stack Size ***

Comment out the 'limit' command in cns_solve_env; it is not supported.
Stack limits are hard-wired at link time. To define the stack size when
linking via a Gnu compiler, use "-Wl,--stack,SIZE", where SIZE is a
decimal number, or a hex number prefixed by '0x'. See the gfortran_mp
makefile header for an example. The default stack should be sufficient
for non-OpenMP versions.

*** Symlinks ***

Cygwin uses native NTFS symlinks where possible, but unfortuantely
cannot be used in Vista. The simulated symlinks are not interprted by
Windows, so the HTML documentation cannot be viewed correctly outside of
Cygwin unless symlinks are converted to copies.

*** Refloat Utility ***

If you want to run the input tests from the main Makefile, you will have
to compile the "refloat" utility yourself. The utils Makefile needs
"lex" renamed to "flex".

*** Local Apache cns_web Server ***

Cygwin includes Apache web servers, which can be used to set up a local
web server to run cns_web without internet access. For some releases
of Cygwin Apache, the module DLLs must be rebased, or the server
dies with errors in /var/log/apache/error_log. Fix this with:

# rebase -b 0x70000000 -o 0x10000 /lib/apache/*.dll

For the CNS install scripts:
  start of WWW tree is: /var/www/htdocs
  CGI directory is: /var/www/cgi-bin
  Use Host "localhost" here and in /etc/apache/httpd.conf

To make the entire HTML directory available via Apache:

First, rename libraries and modules directories so they will not
conflict with the document directories of the same name:
# mv /var/www/htdocs/cns_solve_1.3/modules /var/www/htdocs/cns_solve_1.3/modules.dir
# mv /var/www/htdocs/cns_solve_1.3/libraries /var/www/htdocs/cns_solve_1.3/libraries.dir

Edit "/var/www/cgi-bin/cns_solve_1.3/cns.lib" to match:
  $http_moddir  = "/$cns_version/modules.dir";
  $http_libdir  = "/$cns_version/libraries.dir";

Now link all doc/html directories to the web server directory:
# ln -s /usr/local/cns_solve_1.3/doc/html/* /var/www/htdocs/cns_solve_1.3

To start apache:
# /usr/sbin/apachectl start
   (There are many more problems trying to run as a Service.)

Direct your web browser to: http://localhost/cns_solve_1.3
