Small example using HiC-pro matrix format.

1. Download the data: simply type ``make``. The data will be downloaded in a
folder called duan2009. It consists of two files: a bed file and a matrix
file. The matrix file contains the raw Hi-C count data in COO-format (row,
col, data).
2. To launch the code, just type ``pastis-mds .``. The configuration file
``config.ini`` contains basic configuration option: whether to normalize or
not the data with ICE, the number of iteration to run (here, set at 100, which
may not be enough for the code to convrge), the verbosity level, the output
name etc.
3. pastis writes the coordinates of the 3D structure in a text file. Each line
contains the position of a bead. Beads with nan coordinates correspond to
beads with no interaction associated to them.
